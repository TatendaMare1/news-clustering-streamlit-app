Zimbabwe’s farmers push on as land grab compensation flounders,"KWEKWE – In a field of paprika plants in the heart of Zimbabwe, fourth-generation farmer Daniel Burger and relative newcomer Miriam Mupambawashe discuss the quality of the crop.
Burger, 36, and Mupambawashe, 59, are neighbours and partners in efforts to revive the country’s once-flourishing agriculture sector cut down by a ruinous land reform drive in the 2000s.
The reform distributed land from the white minority, which still owned most of the best farmland 20 years after independence in 1980, to the black majority.
Around 4,000 white-owned farms were confiscated, some with deadly violence.
Mupambawashe was among thousands who received land. Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.
Other farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others — including politicians who were handed land — uninterested.
There were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.
“There was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent,” Burger told AFP.
“But being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward,” he said.
Mupambawashe moved to the area from Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres away.
“When we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built,” she said. “Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.”
“They never let us down and said, ‘You grabbed the farm, let’s see if you can do it’. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.”
It was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were “embarrassing”, Mupambawashe said.
But today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.
Burger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.
His family’s land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.
Nonetheless, “For a long time we became wound up in compensation,” said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.
“But it wasn’t our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward,” he said.
Compensation frustration
This year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.
The process has been complex and divisive.
The government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.
It announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.
Unable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.
In April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.
Deon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.
The bonds are “unsecured” and there is “limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government,” he told AFP.
“The general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything,” Theron said.
But the Property and Farm Compensation Association said its members would take what is on offer.
The bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that “digging in” and seeking more from the government would be futile.
Mupambawashe and Burger are encouraged by another major government announcement — the granting of land ownership rights to beneficiaries of the 2000s land reform.
The tenure announced late last year replaces 99-year leases and means the new owners can deal with the property as they wish, including putting it up for sale.
“It makes us feel settled,” Mupambawashe said. “No one could come and tell us to move off the land or take it away from us.”
“It is just going to catapult us forward as a nation and an economy,” Burger said. “We used to be the breadbasket of Africa and we lost it somewhat. But I just look at where we are now.” – AFP

"The storied, sometimes questionable and funny, history of one of sports' greatest trophies","Montreal Canadiens
In almost cartoon-like fashion, the Montreal Canadiens left the trophy on the side of the road after winning it in 1924. The story goes that a car carrying some of the team had stalled going up a hill, meaning players had to get out to push. It wasn’t until they reached the top that they realized they had left one of the most famous trophies in the world behind!
Prized possession
The Stanley Cup is looked after by a team of people with the title of “Keeper of the Cup.” These people travel with the trophy, keeping it clean and, more importantly, safe. At least one member of the team is always with the trophy when it's in public. “We get called different things too. People have fun with it. They call us Cup keepers, Cup dudes, Cup guys. You know, handlers is all kinds of terms, but in essence, we're basically babysitting the Cup,” Howie Burrow, Keeper of the Cup, told CNN Sports.
Edmonton Oilers
It’s only natural that players want to party after finally getting their hands on the trophy and that seemed to be the case with the Edmonton Oilers following the magical final series in 1987, where the Oilers blew a 3-1 series lead, but managed to pull off the win in Game 7 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Led by Mark Messier, both on and off the ice, the Oilers reportedly went partying to celebrate and accidentally damaged the Stanley Cup over the course of the night, requiring repairs before being returned.
Global tour
The Stanley Cup has traveled to dozens of countries around the world, including places such as Afghanistan, Japan, Scotland and the UAE. It doesn’t get a first-class seat, though. Instead, it flies underneath the airplane in a very secure box. “When I'm getting my boarding passes, I'll open it up to show whoever's checking me in, but soon as I do that, there's usually about a dozen people in the other lines going, ‘Oh my God, that's a Stanley Cup. Can I get a photo? Can I touch it?’” Burrow told CNN.
Pittsburgh Penguins
One thing the trophy’s handlers insist on is that the Cup shouldn’t get wet – although that didn’t stop the Pittsburgh Penguins. Now legendary photos show the team celebrating with the trophy in Canadian star Mario Lemieux’s swimming pool. Luckily, though, it seems like the trophy floated.
All shapes and sizes
The Stanley Cup we see today has been the same shape since 1948, but it hasn’t always looked the same. The first ever iteration of the trophy, back in 1892, was just a bowl and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. Over the years, more tiers have been added to it and now the Cup stands at 35.25 inches and weighs 34.5 pounds. “If you have to hang on to it for a long time and say, you have to walk a block or two because you're following somebody, it does get heavy. You're switching arms, or you got to put it down. You can work up a good sweat. But when the players first win it, right after on the ice, I mean, I'm sure it weighs hardly anything to them,” Burrow said to CNN.
New York Rangers
It seems even animals can enjoy the “People’s trophy.” In 1994, a photo was taken of Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin eating out of the trophy while at New York’s Belmont Park. New York Rangers star Eddie Olczyk was rumored to be behind the stunt, but he’s since denied responsibility.
Etched into history
Each player of the winning team has their name etched into a band which is then placed onto the trophy – with older bands being retired through the years. Given the number of winners, it’s not surprising that a few spelling mistakes have creeped onto the prestigious Cup.
Detroit Red Wings
What’s the worst thing you could imagine happening to – or in – the Stanley Cup? Well, this might be it. When Kris Draper had his day with the trophy, he celebrated by putting his baby daughter in the Cup for a photo. Only she left behind a little surprise… by using the legendary trophy as a toilet.
Summer tour
Since 1995, every player who wins the Stanley Cup is allowed a day to celebrate with it – sometimes two – in any way they deem fit. The trophy is then returned to NHL trustees before the new season, meaning every team bids to win the prestigious trophy again.
Pittsburgh Penguins
Forward Josh Archibald got creative and used his time with the Cup to baptize his son. Three-week-old Brecken was photographed receiving his blessing while sitting in the bowl at the top of the trophy. Quite the experience for someone not even a month out in the world.
Record winners
No team in history has gotten its hands on the Stanley Cup more than the Montreal Canadiens. The Habs have won it 24 times, including a record five-in-a-row from 1956 to 1960. The franchise's first win came in 1916 – before the NHL even ran the tournament. The Canadiens haven't won it since 1993, though, and last reached the final in 2021.
Washington Capitals
In 2018, Capitals defenseman Dmitry Orlov decided to celebrate with the trophy in his hometown, the southwestern Siberian city of Novokuznetsk. The Cup had to take a myriad of connecting flights to reach the destination and you can probably guess what happened. The trophy missed one of its flights and was left behind in Moscow. A helicopter was chartered in order to reclaim it quickly!",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2025/06/04/sport/stanley-cup-nhl-history-spt/,2025-06-04 00:00:00,cnn,sports,"CNN,Ben Church,Agne Jurkenaite,Marco Chacon,Alicia Johnson"

Zimbabwe want to host England at Victoria Falls,"England are in early discussions to tour Zimbabwe for the first time since 2004, with a new ground near Victoria Falls earmarked as the likely venue.
They have not played in the country since four one-day internationals 21 years ago, after cricket ties were severed in 2008 for political reasons.
Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) officials have used this week’s one-off Test at Trent Bridge to strengthen relations with their counterparts at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).
The possibility of a bilateral series on Zimbabwean soil in the next cycle of the Future Tours Programme (FTP) from 2027 to 2031 has been raised during talks between senior figures of the two boards.
Discussions are at a very early stage and there is no indication as to the format, or the number of matches, but sources have told BBC Sport they are “very optimistic” an agreement can be reached.
A bilateral white-ball series would appear the most likely option, but a one-off Test – potentially as a precursor to a longer Test tour of nearby South Africa – might hold more appeal to travelling England supporters.
The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority has been present at Trent Bridge, where they have been actively promoting the country as a holiday destination.
ZC is currently overseeing the construction of a new ground near Victoria Falls, named the Fale Mosi-oa-Tunya International Cricket Stadium, which it hopes will be a draw to visiting fans because of its location close to the waterfalls and safari excursions.
The 10,000-seater venue is being built with financial support from the International Cricket Council (ICC), at a cost between £4m and £8m, for the 2027 50-over World Cup which Zimbabwe is co-hosting with South Africa and Namibia.
ECB chief executive Richard Gould was among the delegates at a recent ICC board meeting in Zimbabwe which included a visit to Victoria Falls.
It is possible England could play in Zimbabwe at the 2027 World Cup, with the ICC yet to determine the schedule.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/zimbabwe-want-to-host-england-at-victoria-falls/,2025-05-26 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,

Explaining press traps in football,"Those who enjoy 1xBet sports betting Uganda can also wager on teams that have different strategies.
Within this system, “press traps” are a clever tactical tool teams use to regain possession high up the pitch. A press trap is essentially a deliberate setup by the defending team to lure the opponent into a specific area of the field, only to aggressively press him once they enter it. There are 3 objectives that can be achieved with this:
isolate the ball carrier;
limit his passing options;
and force a mistake.
Something to enjoy when making sports betting at 1xBet Uganda is to wager on teams with great defensive setups.
How it works
Press traps often start by letting the opponent believe he has a safe passing route. Defenders may slightly back off or subtly invite a pass to a certain player or side. For example, a team might allow the opponent’s full-back to receive the ball near the touchline. Once the ball is played there, multiple players quickly swarm the receiver, doing 2 things: cutting off nearby options and boxing them in against the sideline, where there’s less space to maneuver. A foot bet today can be made at 1xBet on various things that happen during football matches too.
There are several types of press traps. One common version is the touchline trap, where the sideline acts as an “extra defender.” Another is the central trap, which is riskier but highly rewarding, where a team tempts the opponent to play into the middle before collapsing on the ball carrier. You are always invited to try a foot ball bet today at the 1xBet website on the best defenders from world football.
Some teams also use back pass traps, encouraging a pass to the goalkeeper or center-backs under pressure, leading to rushed clearances or turnovers.
Tricking the opponent
Executing a press trap successfully requires 3 ingredients: coordination, communication, and timing. All pressing players must move as a unit to cut off passing lanes without leaving gaps elsewhere. If even 1 player mistimes the press, the opponent can easily break through and exploit the space left behind. A good reason to register 1xBet is to be able to bet on teams who succeed in using press traps.
Press traps are most famously used by teams that play high-energy, aggressive football, like Arne Slot’s Liverpool or Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. However, they are not limited to the top clubs. Even lower-league and youth teams use simplified versions of press traps to great effect. All football fans are invited to register at 1xBet, where among other things, they will be able to bet on Liverpool, Manchester City and other teams too.

Bashir’s six-wicket haul seals dominant England win over Zimbabwe,"NOTTINGHAM, England – Shoaib Bashir took six wickets to return his best figures in Test cricket as England completed a dominant innings and 45-run win over Zimbabwe in a one-off match at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Zimbabwe, following-on, were dismissed for 255 on the third day of four after England had made a commanding 565-6 declared in their first innings that featured hundreds from Zak Crawley (124), Ben Duckett (140) and Ollie Pope (171).
Off-spinner Bashir, who before arriving in Nottingham had only taken two first-class wickets this season at a hugely expensive average of 152, had Test-best figures of 6-81 from 18 overs to finish with a match haul of 9-143.
“It was nice to be back in rhythm,” player-of-the-match Bashir told the BBC after enjoying yet more Test success in Nottingham, where he took a previous Test-best 5-41 against the West Indies last year.
“At the start of the year I went on loan (from Somerset to Glamorgan) just to get some overs under my belt.”
He added: “The (England) boys and backroom staff make you feel 10 foot tall.”
Bashir is still only 21 and this was just his 16th Test, with England captain Ben Stokes saying: “The way he has asserted himself was exceptional. He knows he has the backing of the dressing room and myself… He is going from strength to strength.”
Bashir removed the aggressive Sean Williams (88) and obdurate opener Ben Curran (37) either side of lunch after the third-wicket duo had nearly batted through all of Saturday’s first session in what was Zimbabwe’s first Test in England in 22 years.
Williams was on course to regain the record for the fastest Test century by a Zimbabwe batsman he had lost to Brian Bennett earlier in this match.
But 12 minutes before lunch, he was lbw sweeping at Bashir for an 88 off just 82 balls including 16 fours.
Together with Curran he shared a century stand that revived Zimbabwe from the depths of 7-2.
Zimbabwe were roared on by a colourful band of supporters in Nottingham, with skipper Craig Ervine saying: “Our fans are like no other. A huge thank you to them.”
He added: “The first day didn’t go our way but the guys bounced back after that. Brian Bennett played an unbelievable innings.”
Curran, was dropped twice by Stokes and reprieved by a review when given out lbw on the field to Bashir.
But the son of the late Zimbabwe all-rounder Kevin and brother of England internationals Sam and Tom — gave his wicket away on 37 when he drove Bashir to Stokes at cover.
Stokes, playing his first match of the year in any form of cricket following hamstring surgery, then made another telling intervention with the ball after taking two first-innings wickets.
But he needed the help of Harry Brook, hit in the face while fielding at slip earlier in the session, to remove Wessly Madhevere for 31.
Madhevere struggled to get over the top of a sharply rising short ball from Stokes and his outside edge was brilliantly caught one-handed high above his head by a leaping Brook to the visible disbelief of the England skipper.
Bashir, who during Zimbabwe’s first-innings 265 become the youngest England bowler to take 50 Test wickets, then bowled Tafadzwa Tsiga with a superb off-break that clipped leg stump.
Sikandar Raza made a 57-ball fifty before he too succumbed to Bashir.
The match ended when Tanaka Chivanga was lbw to Bashir, with Zimbabwe then nine wickets down but with injured paceman Richard Ngarava absent hurt after he was also unable to bat in the first innings. – AFP

Blast from the past: Zimbabwe are finally coming in from the cold,"Abiting wind swept across Grace Road on Thursday and though the crowd was thin, there was just enough stardust to keep the autograph hunters happy. Andrew Flintoff was perched on the pavilion balcony, while Mark Wood, trying his hand at coaching during his latest injury layoff, patrolled the boundary’s edge with a smile.
Out in the middle there were also runs for Josh de Caires, son of Mike Atherton, who compiled a fluent 79 from 93 balls on a green-tinged pitch. De Caires is a player in the modern mould charting his own course but some of the old man’s mannerisms were there to see. Mercifully, the lower back appears to be much less creaky.
But more noteworthy than the Professional County Club Select XI – a team of fresh-faced rookies led by De Caires, coached by Flintoff, and with selector Luke Wright in attendance – was the identity of their opponents. Zimbabwe have arrived for a one-off, four-day Test match against England that gets under way at Trent Bridge next Thursday, their first appearance on these shores for 22 years.
Much has changed since a series chiefly remembered for Jimmy Anderson, peroxide highlights in his hair, bursting out of the traps with five wickets on his debut at Lord’s. Tour games have largely gone the way of the Nokia 3310 (the must-have mobile phone back then, kids) and Zimbabwe have slipped from feisty overachievers, a team laced with a good deal of quality, to the unofficial second tier of Test cricket.
Indeed, after the Test next week (a warmup for England before the five-Test visit of India) Zimbabwe stick around to play South Africa in a four-day game at Arundel. That third and final game on tour is preparation for the Proteas ahead of their World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord’s next month – a competition that Zimbabwe, along with Afghanistan and Ireland, are currently excluded from.
Still, truncated though it is – a far cry from 2003, when they played two Tests and took part in an ODI tri-series along with South Africa – this tour is a welcome development. And in something of a first, the England and Wales Cricket Board is also paying the visitors a tour fee in lieu of a reciprocal trip not sitting in the future tours programme.
This apparent benevolence is in part driven by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s broadcast deal with Sky, which is predicated on delivering six Test matches every season; in the years that bring India or Australia for their usual five-match series, an early summer opponent is still needed. Ireland fulfilled this role before the 2023 Ashes, now it is Zimbabwe’s turn.
But while a schedule-filler, it would not have come about had relations between the ECB and Zimbabwe Cricket not thawed considerably in recent times, nor had the green light not come from the British government. After the dark days of Robert Mugabe’s brutal regime, and a period of considerable turmoil for cricket in Zimbabwe in which corruption was alleged to be rife, relative stability has returned to the country.
How Zimbabwe will fare in Nottingham next week is tricky to call, with their diet of Test cricket so skinny in recent years. There are just 108 caps spread among their 15-man squad (Joe Root, by comparison, has racked up 152 on his own). As the county kids cut loose to post 330 all out inside 72 overs, including half-centuries from tailenders Sebastian Morgan and Jafer Chohan, it did not augur massively well.
Equally, there was a creditable 1-1 draw in Bangladesh last month, one that featured Zimbabwe’s first away victory for seven years, and there are players of some promise in their ranks. Blessing Muzarabani, a towering 6ft 6in quick who claimed nine wickets in Sylhet, could pose some problems for England on the right surface – much as New Zealand’s similarly giant Will O’Rourke did during their last outing.
As well Muzarabani, who nicked off De Caires with a sharp delivery that climbed, there is Sikandar Raza, the Pakistani-born all-rounder who has been a world-class performer in the white-ball formats.
Experience comes from Sean Williams and skipper Craig Ervine, both 39, while Gary Ballance, though retired after a brief return to the country of his birth, is sharing local knowledge as their batting consultant.
This short tour may serve to warm up their opponents in the main but for Zimbabwe, out in the cold for more than two decades, there is sunshine breaking through.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/blast-from-the-past-zimbabwe-are-finally-coming-in-from-the-cold/,2025-05-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,Ali Martin

England pummel Zimbabwe in run fest at Trent Bridge,"NOTTINGHAM, England – Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope scored centuries to take England to a massive 498 for three at the close on the first day of their one-off test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge on Thursday.
Having pummelled the visitors’ military medium seam attack, Pope will resume on 169 from 163 balls with Harry Brook unbeaten on 10 as the home side scored at 5.66 runs an over in a dominant display in Zimbabwe’s first test in England for 22 years.
Opener Duckett smashed 140 from 134 balls before he was caught at cover by Ben Curran off the bowling of Wessly Madhevere after putting on an opening stand of 231 with Crawley in 41.3 overs.
The latter was more measured but reached a first test century in almost two years with 124 from 171 balls before he was trapped leg before wicket by spinner Sikandar Raza playing across the line.
Crawley added 137 in 142 deliveries for the second wicket with Pope as Zimbabwe’s tame seamers failed to find a consistent line and length, and offered up far too many half-volleys and width that was easily punished.
“It is a fantastic feeling to score a test hundred and a great day for the team as well,” Crawley told Sky Sports. “With Ben playing as well as he did, I didn’t feel a heap of pressure. And then Ollie came in and played the same way.
“I always want a big score and I was disappointed when I got out because there were more runs there for the taking.”
Joe Root passed 13,000 test runs before he attempted a hook off Blessing Muzarabani and was caught at deep fine leg by Sean Williams for 34.
Pope will be eyeing his highest test score of 205 on Friday with England looking to bat once in the four-day match as they prepare for the series against India and later on the Ashes in Australia.
Pope and Crawley have been short of runs in recent times, and with Jacob Bethell an option to come into the side, their centuries could not have been better timed, even if they came against a modest test attack.
“You feel part of the team again, you don’t want to feel like you are hanging on,” Crawley said. “There are certain times you feel like you are playing for your place and I have certainly felt that loads of times in my career.
“There are so many great players in this team that you try and match them and keep up with them.”
Zimbabwe were handicapped when Richard Ngarava, arguably the pick of their four pacemen with none for 42 in nine overs, left the field shortly after lunch having pulled up clutching his back and hamstrings when chasing a ball.
Ngarava returned late in the final session but did not bowl again before leaving the field once more.
Earlier, Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine won the toss and fielded in the hope his attack could utilise the cloud cover above Trent Bridge, a ground renowned for aiding pacemen.
His decision was all the more understandable given Zimbabwe’s 138-run thrashing by a youthful combined county side in their lone warm-up match last week.
But while Zimbabwe’s four quicks got the occasional ball to deviate sharply, they also repeatedly over-pitched and bowled too short. – Reuters/A

Mbare Art Space: a colonial beer hall in Zimbabwe has become a vibrant arts centre,"In southern Africa townships were built as segregated urban zones for black people. They were created under colonial and white minority rule policies that controlled movement, confined opportunity, and kept people apart.
I grew up in a different historic black township in Zimbabwe, but Mbare was the first of its kind. It holds a unique place in the nation’s imagination.
Mbare was originally named Harare. But in 1982 that name was reassigned to the capital city that houses it. In its storied past, it was once the heartbeat of black urban life. At its centre is Rufaro Stadium, where Bob Marley and the Wailers famously performed at Zimbabwe’s independence celebrations.
The township was a hub of cultural energy, sports, and political activism, and the community beer hall served as a vital gathering point. Today, many of these beer halls stand derelict.
These once-thriving communal spaces reflect a broader neglect of civic infrastructure in post-independence Zimbabwe. Yet out of these ruins, new life is taking shape.
One of the most influential figures in Zimbabwe’s artist-run spaces movement, Moffat Takadiwa, has transformed one of these former beer halls into the Mbare Art Space. The dynamic arts hub reclaims the building’s original spirit of gathering, creativity and public engagement.
Operating under a long lease from the Harare City Council, this nonprofit initiative is part of a wider urban renewal and adaptive reuse project aimed at reimagining the city’s cultural infrastructure.
My ongoing work in archival research includes mapping and visiting historical and cultural spaces like this. Here Takadiwa saw the potential for not just studios and an exhibition venue, but also for dialogue and community regeneration.
Transforming spaces
Beer halls were established by British colonial authorities in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) as part of a strategy of social control over the African urban population. They were designed to regulate leisure, restrict political organising and generate revenue through the sale of alcohol. By centralising drinking in state-run facilities, colonial administrators aimed to monitor and contain African social life while profiting from it.
Situated in a repurposed colonial-era beer garden, Mbare Art Space turns a former site of segregation into a vibrant centre of artistic and communal revival. It redefines a legacy of constraint and control as one of creative freedom and empowerment. The place is now an artists’ haven with studios, office space, an exhibition hall and a digital hub.
Takadiwa’s vision is informed by global precedents, notably inspired by US artist Theaster Gates, whose work includes the transformation of a derelict bank on Chicago’s South Side. It became the Stony Island Arts Bank – a hybrid space for art, archives and community engagement.
Takadiwa opened Mbare Art Space in 2019 with a vision to support emerging artists through mentorship and access to resources. True to his artistic philosophy – resurrecting abandoned, often overlooked materials suffering the effects of urban decay – he revitalised a neglected site. Most of the artists working from this space follow his lead, upcycling and recycling found materials into compelling visual forms that speak to both history and possibility.
When I arrive, Takadiwa is on his way out, but offers me a quick tour of his studio, where works in progress for his upcoming participation in the São Paulo Biennale are taking shape.
Known for his lush, densely layered sculptures and tapestry-like works made from found objects – computer keyboards, bottle tops, toothbrushes, and toothpaste tubes – Takadiwa has garnered international acclaim. His works are collected by US rapper Jay-Z and major institutions like the Centre National d’Art Plastique in Paris, the European Parliament’s art collection in Brussels, and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare.
Collaboration
What Takadiwa is building is not just an arts centre – it’s a new model space rooted in history and responsive to the present. The site itself becomes an ongoing installation, activated by the artists, curators and community members who inhabit it.
Tafadzwa Chimbumu, the operations manager, takes over the tour, guiding me through the rest of the precinct. The site retains the bones of its beer hall architecture, but it bursts with new life. Colourful murals adorn the walls. Tents draped over smaller buildings animate the exposed brickwork.
Plans are underway to establish a library here, a resource where researchers and artists can engage with Zimbabwe’s under-documented art history. Much of this history is scattered across archives and unpublished dissertations, rather than in widely available books. The aim is to bring these materials together and make them more accessible to the public.
Mbare Art Space is also becoming an exciting hub for collaboration and education. Community workshops, for example, are led by resident artists. Local schools take part in art education initiatives. Through community outreach and educational programming, the centre is extending its impact beyond its immediate geography.
As it looks to the future, Mbare Art Space is focused on expanding its artist-in-residence programme, inviting both local and international artists to immerse themselves in the context of Mbare and Zimbabwe.
Ultimately, what the space offers is something intangible – a feeling, a memory, a vision of what is possible when history and imagination meet in a shared place.

"Zimbabwean Filmmaker, Activist Chosen for Spendlove Prize","Tsitsi Dangarembga, a renowned Zimbabwean filmmaker, novelist and cultural activist, was selected as the 16th recipient of the Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance .
Tsitsi Dangarembga is best known for her critically acclaimed 1988 debut novel, “Nervous Conditions.” The first book by a Black Zimbabwean woman to be published in English, it won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize and is celebrated for its incisive portrayal of colonialism, gender and identity in postcolonial Africa.
The novel is part of a trilogy, followed by “The Book of Not” (2006) and “This Mournable Body” (2018). The latter made a short list for the Booker Prize.
Dangarembga also is an accomplished filmmaker, with her work often focusing on African women’s experiences. She founded the International Images Film Festival for Women in Zimbabwe, advocating for more representation of women in African cinema. She also founded the Institute of Creative Arts for Progress in Africa (ICAPA), which aims to develop filmmakers who can boost Africa’s presence in the growing global film economy.
The Spendlove Prize is made possible by a generous gift from Sherrie Spendlove, a Merced native. It was founded in 2005 in honor of her parents, Alice and Clifford Spendlove, who were lifelong professionals dedicated to the lives of citizens, youth and students of the Merced region.
Every year, the Spendlove Prize honors an individual who can serve as a role model and inspirational figure for students, faculty and the community surrounding UC Merced. The prize has an annual value of $15,000.
“We are extremely pleased to add the contributions of this exciting artist-activist to the Spendlove Prize,” said Spendlove and her son, Micah Gallo. “This is the first prolific filmmaker we have had as a recipient, and we look forward to seeing more of her work in the future.”
A dedicated activist, Dangarembga has spoken out against corruption and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, notably being arrested in 2020 for protesting against political repression. Her commitment to social justice, both through art and activism, has made her a prominent voice in Zimbabwe and internationally.
Dangarembga studied psychology at the University of Zimbabwe and earned a master’s degree in directing at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin. She is currently working on fiction and non-fiction literary projects. She has a slate of fiction films in development through ICAPA.
“Tsitsi Dangarembga’s remarkable achievements in advancing justice and tolerance exemplify the ideals of the Spendlove Prize,” said Leo Arrioloa, dean of UC Merced’s School of Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts. “Her profound contributions to the arts and activism have not only amplified the voices of African women but have also illuminated the pressing issues of human rights on the global stage.”
The public is invited to an event honoring Dangarembga on Nov. 13 at UC Merced’s Lakireddy Grand Ballroom. An award ceremony is scheduled for 5 p.m. and a reception at 6 p.m. Dangarembga will give a talk titled “Ubuntu 2.0: Thoughts on a More Equal World from an Old African Institution.”
Past recipients of the prize include the Dalai Lama, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú Tum, psychology professor and activist Faye Crosby, and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/10/zimbabwean-filmmaker-activist-chosen-for-spendlove-prize/,2024-10-22 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,

DUDU MANHENGA in concert: LIVE!,"Promising a trip down memory lane, the show is all about Dudu reaching out to reconnect with her
audience – this after a period out of the spotlight when, other than guesting at a few jazz events
and festivals locally, she has been immersed in ministry of the Gospel and some social
entrepreneurial endeavours that include developing an educational facility for children in need.
The playlist for the evening will include some of her best-loved music from the 6 albums to her
credit since 2003, songs which have been welcomed and celebrated not only by Zimbabwean
audiences but beyond our borders through her performances in countries including South Africa,
Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Eswatini, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Spain, Italy and Serbia.
‘Dudu Live in Concert’ is an opportunity to come and hang out, catch up with the star and, as well
as tripping down memory lane on favourite tunes, having the great opportunity of catching the
first glimpse of her new material. Half an hour into the concert which starts at 7pm, the show will
take the audience online for a sneak preview of her most recent production – the song and video of
‘Munotidisisa’, hot from the studio – and the chance to be among the first to buy it online.
Dudu has been performing professionally since 1997 at the age of 16, and by 2012 had recorded 5
albums.
She performed widely in Zimbabwe, both solo and alongside some of the nations top
artists and those from other countries, too many to be named here. Among other tours, in 2009
she toured the Southern African region under the FLAME project, as the Zimbabwean collaborator
with women artists from South Africa and Mozambique. She toured in Italy in 2011, with
performances in various cities, and again in 2012, which included a special performance for Pope
Benedict XVI, where she received the ‘Italian 25th Grand Prix Award for Social Communication’.
Dudu is considered a world-class act. Her style is influenced by great African and jazz singers, and
the dignity of her delivery is a credit to her and to her country, wherever she goes.
The Friday 11 October concert at the Zimbabwe-German Society will be an up-close-and-personal
opportunity for fans to reconnect with her, and new audiences to experience what has been
described as “an Afrojazz adventure”.

"Colonial white boys in Zimbabwe: John Eppel’s autobiography is a welcome book, but a difficult read","Nhlanhla Dube, University of Cape Town
Zimbabwean writer John Eppel’s literary career has always been defined by one peculiar trait. He publishes fictional work, in stark contrast to the majority of the country’s other white writers who have fetishised the autobiographical mode.
During the post 2000s period, white Zimbabwean narratives of crisis which focused on the land reform programme gained an international following.
Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle was fought primarily over the land question. In colonial Rhodesia, racist apportionment of fertile land meant that the black majority was removed from productive farmland. The land reform programme sought to correct this historical injustice.
Eppel’s focus on novels, poetry and short stories explains why he is rarely ever mentioned with autobiographical writers such as Peter Godwin, Alexandra Fuller, Judith Todd and Douglas Rogers.
His shift to the autobiographical mode with A Colonial Boy: Sketches of My Life Before Zimbabwean Independence, 1950-1980 from indie publisher Pigeon Books, invites those of us who are scholars of his work to re-interrogate his writing.
The literary sketch
In A Colonial Boy, Eppel takes the reader through his early days in South Africa and Swaziland and his arrival in Southern Rhodesia with his family. In the prologue, he sets up the context:
For this collection I wanted to write about the comic side of my life as a Rhodesian, and the sketch, as a literary genre, seemed more appropriate than a conventional autobiography. Although the sketch has a pedigree going back to the 16th century, my interest in it was sparked by Charles Dickens’ first published book Sketches by ‘Boz’.
Eppel is an English teacher and literary critic. Literary analysis even informs some of his fictional characters. One gets the sense that he intends to make A Colonial Boy Dickensian in gravity, scope and quality.
The literary sketch is an uncommon mode. This complicates our understanding of how Eppel tries to deliver his life’s story. Sketches are meant to be brief chronicles of particular events which are not usually connected to a larger story. It’s doubtful that the linear timeline of a human life can be accurately represented through the literary sketch.
The randomness of the sketch as a stylistic method does not adhere well to the classical image of the autobiographer as a “self-interested individual intent on assessing the status of the soul”. This becomes apparent when Eppel moves quickly from sketch to sketch without giving full details and reflection on the incidents being invoked.
Even when writing this book review, it is difficult to give you, the reader, an accurate idea of what Eppel has to say, on reflection, about his earlier years. The scenes (or sketches) do not demonstrate a unity of purpose. Rather than Eppel saying “this is what happened in my life and I would like you to know about it so that you get to know me better”, the reader gets “this is what happened on a random day in a particular year in colonial Rhodesia, so make of it what you will”. To be fair, Eppel does warn the reader in advance:
What you will find in these pages is a series of anecdotes about me from toddlerhood to my early thirties.
Fine. But what is the point of this randomness?
My reading is that it’s an attempt to introduce narrative detachment – in the same way as an author would create distance between themself and their character. The problem is, this is not a novel. There should not be a border between the narrator and the protagonist in self life writing.
White men and war
Of course, Eppel might have good reason for wanting to create narrative detachment. Other white Zimbabwean writers have seen their autobiographical writings affect their daily lives. David Coltart’s memoirs, for example, generated much discussion over his role in the Rhodesian security forces. He was one of the many white men required to undergo compulsory service by the white minority government.
In his sketches, Eppel gives very brief details about his time serving in the armed forces. Ever the renegade with a problem with authority, he describes his time in the Rhodesian army as “eight weeks of institutionalised hell”. The Chimurenga war was fought by black nationalists in order to bring about democracy and black majority rule. Eppel essentially acknowledges that morally, he was on the wrong side of that war.
Eppel is also aware of how the literary establishment has labelled his work as Rhodesian racist rhetoric. This is a charge Eppel scholars like myself have tried to fight. Regardless, Eppel wisely refuses to elaborate on his operational activities in the war:
I was involved in one contact, near a post on the Mozambique border called Vila Salazar. I have recorded this contact in poetry (confessional) and in prose (satirical), but there is no place for it on these pages.
The political considerations Eppel had in mind when writing these sketches prevent the reader from gaining a non-fictional account of his wartime experience.
Autobiographies can come in the form of an apologia. This is often a memoir written by politicians at the end of their careers to defend certain policy positions they took. By avoiding the military issue, Eppel wisely moves away from turning these sketches into an apologia.
A welcome book but a difficult read
A Colonial Boy is a welcome book for Eppel scholars such as myself. It does a lot to connect the man to his fiction. However, I struggle to see its relevance to the general readership.
Avid readers of fast paced white Zimbabwean autobiographies will likely lament the lack of action in these sketches. They will probably abhor the sketch form itself. There are no clear villains here. The thematic identifiers that define white Zimbabwean autobiography are absent. There are no enduring images of black Zimbabwean suffering, no corruption, no racial violence, no farms taken, and no white people beaten up.
Perhaps though, this is the point Eppel is trying to make. A life well lived should not have to be a spectacle.

Archaeologists reveal musical instruments depicted in Zimbabwe’s ancient rock art,"Southern Africa has a long history of rock art research. However, research examining the relationship between rock art and music is scarce, especially in Zimbabwe.
“The subject of musical instruments in the rock art or archaeological excavations has not been prioritized. Rock art is one of the most reliable sources of music archaeology if we want to reconstruct the music and sound production of people in the past, and hence, this research focused on rock art. Most previous rock art research in Zimbabwe has focused on other aspects like themes in the rock art and regional variations across Zimbabwe,” says Dr. Kumbani.
However, in the past few years, Prof. Sarah Wurz of the University of the Witwatersrand’s research team has started addressing this research gap and identifying and documenting musical instruments in South Africa. Dr. Kumbani and Prof. Díaz-Andreu’s research is an extension of this research into Zimbabwe.
Rock art is one of the most prevalent archaeological sites in Zimbabwe, found chiefly in the country’s eastern half. Many sites have been located and identified, and more are being discovered today.
The rock art at these sites is composed of two main types: finely painted hunter-gatherer art made by the San and finger-painted farmer rock art made by incoming farmers. For this study, the researchers analyzed only the former.
Once identified, instruments were categorized into four types according to the Hornbostel-Sachs system: ideophones, membranophones, chordophones, and aerophones.
According to Dr. Kumbani, to ensure the objects they were identifying were indeed musical instruments, the postures of the instrument players were taken into account. “We were focusing on the postures of the figures to determine whether they were just holding objects or were playing instruments. For example, flute playing can be identified by someone holding a pipe with both hands, and the pipe is near the mouth, which is the source of the air that is blown into the aerophone.
“Rattle playing is usually characterized by someone holding the gourds or pear-shaped implements, and the hands are normally flexed at an angle, which may indicate the movement of hands as one shakes the idiophones.”
The researchers successfully identified rattles, a drum, trumpets, flutes, and a bullroarer. Most of these were concentrated in the Harare Province, Mashonaland East Province, and the Matobo World Heritage Cultural Landscape in Matabeleland South Province.
The researchers noted interesting differences and commonalities in the rock art instruments depicted. For one, there were regional differences. Rattles, which could be hand-held gourds or attached to shoulders and upper arms, were found in Zimbabwe.
However, leg rattles commonly depicted in South African rock art and used in “traditional” Zimbabwean dances today were absent from Zimbabwean rock art.
Dr. Kumbani says this absence of leg rattles in Zimbabwean rock art may stem from cultural differences. “This could be because of different instrument type preferences among the groups who made the art, and it shows regional variation, which may indicate that the art was made by different cultural groups.”
Similarly, musical bows, which are bows whose strings are plucked to make a sound, are absent in Zimbabwe. While depicted in other southern African rock art, these regional distinctions are mirrored in other known regional differences, such as Zimbabwe’s preference for depicting Kudu compared to South Africa’s focus on the eland.
In addition to regional trends, it was noted that many musical instrument depictions also had links to trance motifs. San shamans perform trance dances for various reasons, including healing. When depicting this act in rock art, various motifs are often used, such as therianthropes (human-animal hybrids), crouching or bending forward, having one’s hair stand erect, having elongated bodies, or having distended stomachs.
Many of these trance motifs were seen accompanying musical instruments, such as rattle images painted with therianthropes, erect hair, and a distended stomach, or a drum depicted together with dancers. These motifs indicate that drums and rattles were closely associated with ritual and ceremony, more so than with entertainment.
Meanwhile, trumpets and flutes were less clearly associated, and in both Zimbabwe and South Africa, could be depicted as being played together with trance motifs or possibly for entertainment.
The rock art sites also reveal interesting gender dynamics in the depiction of musical instrument usage. Rattles were found to be used by both male and female figures. While some shelters only had males or only females using them, at others, like Ngomakurira (Mashonaland East), both males and females were depicted using them.
Meanwhile, other instruments, such as trumpets and flutes, were only associated with males. According to Dr. Kumbani, “We are not quite certain why the pattern is like that. Ethnographically, it is known that among the San communities, women would normally sing and clap, but we do not have much information on instrument playing by women.
“There are no women playing aerophones in the rock art of Zimbabwe, and this might have deep cultural meaning where there are dos and don’ts that are gender constructed. However, we are not sure if the same applied to musical instrument playing. We are of the view that if there were no deep cultural symbolism, it was by choice that men wanted to associate themselves with playing aerophones like flutes and trumpets.”
Dr. Kumbani elaborates, saying, “In some cases, it could be by default; for example, the musical bows players that are depicted in southern Africa seem to be all men, because normally men hunted using the bows which doubled sometimes as musical instruments.”
The insights gleaned from this study of Zimbabwean rock art open up avenues for future interdisciplinary research on the connections between music, rock art, trance, and cultural identity among the San.

The Zimbabwean singer who found fame in China - and obscurity at home,"Harare, Zimbabwe – It was 2017 and Jo Stak – wearing a red tuxedo jacket, a bow tie and a homburg hat – was belting out a Mandarin song.
Red and yellow lights shimmered around him as a crowd of cheering, flag-waving fans on the Chinese version of The Voice gave a standing ovation at the end of his act.
Stak’s melodious rendition of a 1992 Chinese song called The World Needs Warm Hearts was broadcast on national television.
“I was invited to perform at The Voice as a guest performer that year,” Stak recalls.
The prime-time spot reflected how well-known he’d become in China. On Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, he had about five million followers. He’d appeared on some of the country’s biggest television stations. Fans stopped him on the street to ask for a photo or just have a chat. The Zimbabwean singer was riding high.
“Being Black in China makes you stand out naturally,” he explains. “And I was a musician [so that] made me stand out more.”
The people who stopped him were often impressed that a foreigner would sing in Mandarin.
Some ‘big deal’
Today, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Joe Takawira – Stak’s real name – is an inconspicuous figure walking down a street in Budiriro 5, the working class suburb where he was born and raised. In 2019, after seven years in China, his work visa expired, and he returned home.
Sporting his signature beard, grey sweatpants, sneakers and a black T-shirt, he lights a cigarette.
He saunters past street vendors selling fresh produce and condiments, stops at a corner to chat with a friend, then goes about his day. Whenever he runs into someone he knows, he greets them with a fist bump and a toothy grin.
When he’s at home, Stak listens to instrumental music and writes songs in Mandarin.
“This is how I spend my time in Budiriro,” he says, shrugging.
It feels a long way from China and the career he enjoyed there. He has not found the same acclaim back home.
Even his neighbours had no idea about his previous life.
Clemence Kadzomba, who runs a tyre shop in Stak’s neighbourhood, had no idea who his neighbour was until some of his clients who were among the 20,000 Zimbabweans living in China recognised him.
“I couldn’t believe it,” 43-year-old Kadzomba says, grinning.
“They were so excited to see him, like he was some big deal. And yet, here he was, just hanging out with us like it was nothing.”
Unexpected journey to stardom
Stak’s musical journey has its roots in the Methodist church-run school he attended as a teenager.
He sang in his church choir, something he loved, and was part of a group of students who recorded a gospel album.
The album did well, and some of the songs have close to a million views on YouTube.
Music runs in his family, says Stak, the middle of three brothers. His older brother wrote songs at school while the youngest brother plays the piano.
After graduating, Stak enrolled to study Mandarin in China in 2012, motivated by his love for Chinese culture, which began as a boy watching Jackie Chan’s action films. He was 20 years old when he moved to Shanghai.
This came at a time when Zimbabwe was pivoting away from the West with the late leader Robert Mugabe’s “Look East” policy, adopted in response to United States and European Union sanctions after a 2002 presidential election marred by violence.
Mugabe opened Zimbabwe’s doors to Asia, leading to an influx of Chinese investment as more Zimbabweans headed to China to work or study.
By 2014, Stak was proficient in Mandarin and started posting videos of himself singing in Mandarin to Douyin. “I wanted to explore music in a different language,” he explains as he lights a cigarette and sits back in his chair on the red-floored veranda of his house.
He would sing R&B, hip-hop and pop songs in Mandarin and English and started to get booked for gigs.
“My first gig was at Yuyingtang, a music bar in Shanghai,” he recalls. He says the venue wasn’t very big but he made $1,500 – enough to pay for his food and accommodation for months.
That gig made him realise he could make money from his talent, and it marked the start of his career as a professional pop singer in China.
After that, he played at music bars, festivals, weddings and nightclubs – performing mostly in Mandarin.
Of the 37 songs he recorded, one was in the top 10 on the Chinese music streaming service Baidu Music. “It meant a lot to me,” Stak says excitedly, although it earned him only 5,000 yuan ($865).
Then in 2017, he joined the Foundation Band, a group of musicians from Africa, the US and Europe that performed Chinese and Western pop music and hip-hop at weddings and nightclubs.
As the lead vocalist, he caught the attention of Chinese television networks, leading to performances on major stations.
“I was surprised by my success in China,” Stak admits.
Life there was good. His daily routine consisted mainly of “eating, singing and drinking”.
His favourite dish was hotpot – a meal for which diners cook raw ingredients like seafood and tofu in a shared pot of broth at the table.
“Even now, when I miss it, I go to Chinese restaurants,” he says.
He’d perform at night, and during the day, he’d roam along Shanghai’s historic waterfront with its colonial-era architecture and rooftop bars.
Stak made good money. “They pay artists well – I mean 1,000 US dollars minimum for a 10-minute show.”
But he also felt accepted and at home in China, where he says the music industry welcomes foreign talent and invests in it.
Unlike many foreign artists singing in English who can struggle to break into the Chinese market, Stak had an edge – he was an African singing in Mandarin, and there were few performers like him. His ability to perform popular Chinese songs endeared him to audiences.
Coming home to anonymity
Then in 2019, Stak’s visa expired. Aged 27, he returned to a country that was in the midst of a devastating economic crisis.
His parents – his father’s an engineer, his mother’s a teacher – were coping, but across the country, people were struggling with hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages and an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.
Stak found work as a translator – and quickly discovered that Zimbabwe’s music and social media landscapes were unfamiliar to him.
He says much of his fame and success came from Chinese apps, mostly Douyin. But the apps he relied on are available only in China as Beijing restricts foreign digital platforms through its “Great Firewall”.
Without them, Stak could no longer reach his Chinese audience.
His career vanished when he left Shanghai. “I feel like a part of me remained in China,” he explains.
In Zimbabwe, nobody knew him. He started recording some music – and contemplated a switch to gospel, which is popular in the country – but he’s struggled to promote his songs. When he contacted a local radio station to play his music, he never heard back.
Stak believes that if Chinese social media were accessible to global audiences, he would still have a thriving musical career.
“That would have brought me international recognition,” he says.
For now, the translation work pays well. He currently works for a Chinese mining company, translating English or Shona into Mandarin. When he isn’t working, he tries to write music, but full-time work leaves little time to reinvent himself or find an audience for his Chinese pop.
Longing for the stage
Today, Stak is torn. He dreams of a return to China but also wants to rebuild his music career in Zimbabwe, where he hopes to marry and raise a family.
“I want to start afresh here,” he says.
“But I also miss China,” a country that was “very good and welcoming” to him, he adds.
Whether it’s in Asia or Africa, he itches to return to the stage. “I miss the spotlight,” he says.
Five years after he left China, Stak remains popular there. A couple of months ago, his Chinese boss uploaded a video of him singing in Mandarin. “[He] posted me on his WeChat status, and people were asking him about me. They were like, ‘Where is this guy?’”
Stak takes a moment and then adds, “The Chinese love me.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/04/the-zimbabwean-singer-who-found-fame-in-china-and-obscurity-at-home/,2025-04-13 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,

Walking Dead actor Danai Gurira inspires African playwrights with Zimbabwe workshops,"A group of upcoming playwrights is gathering in the Zimbabwean capital Harare this week for an 11-day event organised by celebrated American-Zimbabwean actor Danai Gurira as part of her commitment to nurturing a new generation of dramatic artists in southern Africa.
The Almasi African Playwrights conference is hosted by Almasi Collaborative Arts, the organisation Gurira co-founded in 2011, and offers writers a chance to develop their work with directors and actors. Running from 11 December at Harare’s Reps theatre, it is part of Almasi’s aim to promote and celebrate African storytelling. Gurira is expected to join the group.
Best known for her award-winning roles in the Walking Dead series and Black Panther movies, Gurira is also a dramatist. Her plays include Eclipsed, the first play to premiere on Broadway with an all female and black cast and creative team.
“What I kept experiencing was coming home from the US [to Zimbabwe] and finding people were not getting trained in this field,” Gurira said. “They were telling me they wrote a play in three days! Playmaking is hard, there is no sustainable piece of writing that can be completed in three days. I wanted to expose the Zimbabwean artist to process, so they could develop their talent to its utmost potential. That is the only way we create work that is globally recognised. It is the only way we create work that tells our stories in a way that is undeniable and universal.”
More than 500 African artists have participated in workshops devised by Gurira and Tawenga over the past 11 years and attended by guest actors and other industry figures from the US, including playwright Alice Tuan; Walking Dead producer and writer Matt Negrette; costume designer Clint Ramos and director Lucie Tiberghien, who co-directed Almasi’s most recent play, Family Riots with Almasi alumnus Makomborero Theresa Muchemwa.
The African Playwrights conference is Almasi’s flagship event and has led to the development of 20 plays since it started in 2015. More than 60 playwrights, actors, producers and directors are expected to attend this year.
“There is nothing else like it on this scale – as far as I know. It’s heaven for playwrights”, said Gideon Jeph Wabvuta, a playwright and programme coordinator at Almasi.
He said the event was part of a “growing excitement around theatre in Zimbabwe”, boosted this year by the launch of an Outstanding Playwright category in the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe awards. “This kind of recognition is such a big deal,” he added.
The conference follows Almasi’s staging of Family Riots last month at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare, the organisation’s first full production in more than 10 years. Written by Wabvuta, the play tells the story of an upwardly mobile family in Mbare, Zimbabwe’s oldest township, during the 1998 food riots.
“It is about family and it is about class,” said Wabvuta. “When I started writing the play [in 2013], the people were based on my parents. But I kept writing for so long that the people in the play became me and my wife!”
Wabvuta said the gallery was chosen as a venue in part because he wanted to offer a different experience to attract people who might not usually go to the theatre. “One couple came because their son, a standup comedian, recommended it. They had never been to the theatre before.”
Gurira said the choice of venue also reflected Almasi’s mission. “I love the idea of collaborating with another form of African art. We are called Almasi Collaborative Arts and the idea of a collaboration like this felt exciting and different for us. Let’s merge the visual arts with installation art, and musical art with theatre art,” she added.
Wabvuta, who joined Almasi’s programme in its first year and attended the University of Southern California MFA dramatic writing programme, said that while he was optimistic about the new crop of writers, funding was a significant barrier to making a living from theatre. His role at Almasi gives him the financial stability to continue his work as a playwright. Others have not been as lucky.
Many of the 500 or so artists Almasi has trained have left the profession because of poor pay. “Our industry struggles to keep its people,” said Wabvuta. “It’s a money issue”, adding that the lead actor in Family Riots, Michael Kudakwashe, gave up acting to pursue a full-time job but agreed to take on the role for this production.
Associate director at Almasi Zaza Muchemwa believes that offering professional training will help create a more dynamic and robust dramatic arts scene in Zimbabwe.
“I was always keenly aware of what this [dramatic arts] space is and what it could be. When Almasi began, there weren’t a lot of organisations or tertiary institutions that were training creatives.”
Gurira added that seeing young playwrights grow in confidence was one of the most rewarding parts of her role at Almasi. “Seeing them get to explore their craft and impress even themselves. That means everything. Those artists will never be the same. Their work has transformed, and so have they. That has been very gratifying.”
She added that Almasi planned to work more with local partners such as businesses and embassies with the aim of “spearheading a new age in the Zimbabwe entertainment industry”.
“As our name connotes, we seek to collaborate. Our goal lies in what we seek to build, like the name ‘Zimbabwe’ itself, we seek to build a house of stone that lasts.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/12/walking-dead-actor-danai-gurira-inspires-african-playwrights-with-zimbabwe-workshops/,2024-12-12 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,

WhatsApp novelists use messaging app to write and sell books in Zimbabwe,"Harare, Zimbabwe – Sitting on a plastic chair, Kingston Dhewa stares intently at his smartphone, his thumbs jabbing furiously at the screen.
He stops briefly and looks up to attend to a customer at his outdoor fruit and vegetable stall in Budiriro 5, a busy, low-income suburb south of Zimbabwe’s capital Harare.
When the customer leaves, he grabs his phone and resumes typing in a Google Doc.
It’s around midday and the sun blazes mercilessly. Next to him, an elderly woman throws heaps of peeled and neatly cut potatoes into a gas fryer.
Loud local gospel music blasts from a solar-powered radio.
Dhewa presses on writing.
“Customers disturb my train of thought,” he tells Al Jazeera.
Dhewa has been writing for hours now and has to proofread before sending the latest chapter of his new novel to awaiting readers.
After carefully poring over the text for 20 or so minutes, he stops, highlights everything, and copies and pastes it to the WhatsApp messaging app where he sends it to his more than 1,000 followers.
Dhewa is one of the new crop of authors in Zimbabwe selling novels on WhatsApp to customers.
‘I could be writing more’
While some people write in English, Dhewa chose the local Shona language after he was inspired by other Shona authors. His books have a traditional, pre-colonial setting, and generally explore life and themes related to African rural life.
The 52-year-old first tried his hand at writing in high school and almost got published in 1992. But he could not afford the fees needed to publish traditionally.
When COVID-19 hit and authorities in the Southern African country imposed a national lockdown to stem the spread of the virus in March 2020, Dhewa found himself stuck at home. To pass the time, he read some stories that were being shared on WhatsApp – a trend that had started some years before, but really took off during the pandemic.
One group he had joined, called Read and Write, was a common group for budding writers and readers to share their work and recommendations.
“I felt that I could do a much better job [than the authors I read on that group], and wrote a story and submitted it into the group and people encouraged me to keep writing,” he tells Al Jazeera.
His first novel was well received and he earned enough money to pay rent and buy food for his family. He charged each reader $2 for the whole book.
Since then, Dhewa has written and published 43 novels via WhatsApp groups, he says – stories that range from 35 to 45 chapters long.
“I spend three to four hours writing a chapter on average. And I could be writing more if I had a laptop,” he says. For now, he is unable to afford a computer.
Authors like Dhewa begin by writing a story and releasing it on the app in serialised form, typically one chapter at a time. Readers interested in the author or genre typically join.
“I now have four groups that follow my writing on WhatsApp,” he says, as the app has a limit of 1,024 members per group and he has to create new groups to reach his readers as his popularity grows.
The first few chapters of a book are often shared for free to attract readers and build interest. Authors then promote their work on social media, including WhatsApp and Facebook, encouraging readers to join their groups and channels.
Thousands of readers
In the Budiriro 5 suburb of Harare, Clever Pada, a fan of another WhatsApp author, Pamela Ngirazi, opens and reads a chapter of her new book.
Pada runs a small tuckshop in the area where people sometimes gather. He is currently reading Ngirazi’s new book called Prior Replica, written in English.
Ngirazi, who has more than 21,000 followers on WhatsApp, is a full-time writer and very popular.
While Dhewa prefers sharing stories in Groups – that enable two-way communication, with all members able to send and respond to messages – Ngirazi uses a WhatsApp Channel.
Channels are one-way broadcast tools within the app that allow businesses and individuals to communicate with large audiences without the recipients being able to reply directly. Subscribers join the channel to receive messages, which can include text, images, videos, documents and links.
For chapters 1 to 20 of Prior Replica, Ngirazi shared it to the channel for free. But chapter 20 is her last offering.
“Prior Replica is now on sale from chapter 21 to final chapter and will be available on Boom Application that we will give you when pay for the book,” a message sent on the Channel reads.
The Boom Story app streamlines the e-publishing process, making it easier for authors and publishers to produce and distribute digital content.
Pada finds Prior Replica, which is a romance novel, quite intriguing and plans to pay to read the rest of it.
“It doesn’t seem like I have much of a choice now,” the reader says.
To access a full book, readers have to make a payment to the author via mobile money transfer services. Some authors also allow readers to buy their content by paying with mobile phone airtime.
Upon confirmation of payment, the author sends the full book to the reader, typically in PDF format, via WhatsApp. This ensures quick and direct delivery of the content.
e-Books market
Some 5 million of Zimbabwe’s 16 million people use WhatsApp. As of early this year, there are more than 2.05 million social media users aged 18 and above, representing approximately 22.8 percent of the adult population, according to a DataReportal Global Digital Insights report.
In a country where the economy has tanked and high inflation has eroded purchasing power for the majority, the high cost of data forces many Zimbabweans to use WhatsApp as a social tool.
Meanwhile for authors, the messaging app has proven to be a boon as they are able to charge directly for their services. By leveraging the app’s popularity, they are also able to engage and monetise their works.
With the rise of digital platforms and devices, more people around the world, including Zimbabweans, have access to e-books and digital reading options, such as e-readers.
But the economic crisis in the Southern African country means the majority of Zimbabweans do not have disposable incomes for such services and internet access. For instance, 250MB of data – which enables about three hours of internet use – costs $1. In comparison, salaries are not high. A teacher earns close to $300 a month while other average workers earn less.
“Of course, we can turn to Amazon, but how many Zimbabweans can buy stuff on Amazon?” Philip Chidavaenzi, a Zimbabwean author and publisher, tells Al Jazeera via a messaging service.
In 2023, the African e-books market was approximately $173.7m in revenue, with the average revenue per user at $1.47. By 2027, the number of e-Book readers on the continent is expected to reach 147.3m, with the market growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.76 percent to reach $201.3m. User penetration in the African e-books market is forecast to increase to 10.7 percent by 2027.
‘Elitist’ traditional publishing
Despite the popularity of self-publishing on WhatsApp, Chidavaenzi does not consider it a threat to traditional publishing.
“This would not be considered serious because of the possibility of breaching industry standards,” he says.
“Publishing is a very sensitive area requiring a vigorous gate-keeping process to ensure quality control. Anyone can publish anything on WhatsApp, good or bad,” Chidavaenzi adds.
He says the industry has not been spared by what he described as the “economic scourge in the country”.
Zimbabwe is in the grips of a longrunning economic crisis characterised by hyperinflation that has eroded purchasing power, foreign currency shortages and soaring unemployment.
“Publishing is generally an elitist business, and relies on a market with limited disposable incomes that compete with bread and butter … Buying books is the last option after every other commitment has been funded from the available financial resources,” Chidavaenzi says.
In his view, traditional publishing has fallen victim to several economic factors.
Even the traditional cash cow of the industry, textbook publishing, has not been spared.
“Where we could find success in textbook publishing which, all things being equal, should be a cash cow, you will realise piracy has caused havoc in the industry,” he says.
It’s a point Weaver Press founder, Irene Staunton, a veteran industry executive, underscored earlier last year in an interview with Al Jazeera.
Staunton recalled that when she was at Baobab Books, the now-defunct publisher of prize-winning literary works, if one of their titles was a set book on the school curriculum, they could sell as many as 250,000 books. To illustrate the collapse, Staunton said when author Shimmer Chinodya’s novel, Tale of Tamari, was on the school syllabus between 2018 and 2022, her company only sold 2,000 copies in four years.
The industry’s demise has been primarily driven by the widespread illegal photocopying of books, which has reached epidemic levels in the country, rendering a viable publishing industry unsustainable.
Intellectual property
For new digital publishers, copyright and intellectual property may also become a concern, as copies of their works can easily be shared around.
“Zimbabwe’s copyright laws do cover literary works published on digital platforms like WhatsApp,” Jacob Mtisi, an IT expert, told Al Jazeera. “The Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act of Zimbabwe protects the rights of authors, including those who publish their works online or through messaging apps,” Mtisi added.
He said authors can register their works with the Zimbabwe Copyright Office to formally establish their copyright and make it easier to enforce.
“Authors can include clear terms and conditions about how their works can be used, such as prohibiting unauthorised sharing or distribution,” he said.
Additionally, authors could watermark or embed “identifiable metadata in their works to track unauthorised copies”, he added.
Although the legal instruments to deal with the massive intellectual property crime in Zimbabwe exist, Chidavaenzi says that “enforcement is lax”.
The growing number of authors opting for self-publishing has prompted significant changes in Zimbabwe’s publishing industry. Emerging and lesser-known authors are more likely to use WhatsApp publishing, but some like Ngirazi have since achieved popularity and relative success.
Many of the most talented and established Zimbabwean writers are being published by international companies, primarily due to the considerable advantages they receive – such as higher advances, better royalties, and superior book promotion. International exposure also helps them build a global reputation.
But this is a far-fetched dream for most – especially newer writers who have leaned into the alternatives.
“Even if authors resort to WhatsApp, how much are you going to sell?” Chidavaenzi asks. “Can you sell enough to be able to purchase a house or residential stand? It’s impossible,” he adds.
For Dhewa, the serialised self-publishing on WhatsApp has made him a more efficient writer, he says.
It has also allowed him to share local stories that are dear to him with a wider audience. “I want the rest of the world and its people to know [and] love our culture as Africans and how we live as Black people in the rural areas,” he says.
As for his literary career, he hopes WhatsApp can take him places.
“I want to achieve literary success and recognition like that achieved by [popular Shona novelist] Patrick Chakaipa,” Dhewa says.

Harare Open Mic returns,"The open mic, a platform that provides space for artists to experiment with the stage, has been running for the past five years and is becoming a popular space especially for young artists who are trying to grow their brand, gain confidence with the stage as well as network with other artists from different genres.
The organiser of the open mic, Batsirai Chigama says, “I remember a time when this kind of space was offered to us by the Book Cafe. It was a space filled with innumerable opportunities for networking, collaboration and finding one’s feet and voice as a young artist. I feel it is a critical space that offers development of a artist before they hit the big stages. It thrills me to be able to open up possibilities for growth and nurture talent that will one day be big and gracing other different platforms.”
This year, Harare Open Mic has once again partnered with The Garden, One Billion Rising and over thirty two artists who are coming through to perform on the day. Art forms represented include music, comedy, poetry, dance and theatre.
Billed to perform are young and promising poets such as Tadana Nakai, Yvonne Matanhire. These will be supported by more seasoned poets such as Shingirai Manyengavana, Takudzwa Goniwa, Khadijah Finesse, Tamika, Momo Size and Tawanda Vombo.
Young and rising mbira player Aripheleng Kwela is expected to thrill the audience with her powerful voice along side hip-hop star D-Blok, AneUnhu Gwatidzo, Tendai Mhlanga, Nicole Livet, The Breeze and many more young voices coming through to perform at Harare Open Mic for the first time.
Chigama says that the registration was oversubscribed and many others who had wanted to perform could not be accommodated in the March edition. “It is encouraging to see the hunger in the young artists to perform and I hope resources permitting I can be able to organise more regular sessions so that more artists can benefit from this initiative.”
“Harare Open Mic offers an easy laid back family outing. If you have a child, friend or just someone you know who may benefit from being in this space, bring them along, they may learn a thing or two and be inspired to explore more of their talent,” said Chigama

Former minister Joel Gabbuza injured in axe attack,"Unconfirmed reports claim the assailant was a man who suspected Gabbuza of having an affair with his wife.
Some of the reports falsely suggested that Gabbuza had died from his injuries.
However, in a brief telephone interview, his son confirmed that the former MP is alive and receiving medical care.
“He is receiving treatment at Hwange Colliery Hospital. His condition has improved from last night, he is now able to speak. We are making arrangements to transfer him to Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo,” he said.
Gabbuza served as Minister of Water Resources and Development during Zimbabwe’s Government of National Unity and was the long-serving MP for Binga South.
He served as MP for approximately 23 years. He was first elected in 2000 to represent the Binga constituency under the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Following the 2008 electoral boundary changes, which split Binga into Binga North and Binga South, Gabbuza continued as the MP for Binga South. He retained his seat in subsequent elections, including the 2013 general elections. His tenure concluded in October 2023 after he was recalled by self-proclaimed CCC interim secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/former-minister-joel-gabbuza-injured-in-axe-attack/,2025-08-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

"Councillor dumps CCC, to contest Insiza North by-election as independent","By Promise Dube
The seat fell vacant following the death of Farai Taruvinga who was the MP since 2018 on a Zanu PF ticket. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced that the nomination court will sit on 15 May and the by-election will be held on 14 June 2025.
Dube was elected as a councillor under the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) during the 2023 harmonised elections. However, he has now opted to run without party affiliation, citing challenges within the CCC.
“Since there have been numerous issues with CCC and the brand is currently struggling, I plan to run as an independent candidate,” said Dube.
He acknowledged that the decision was not taken lightly and came after considerable reflection.
“I have received advice to stand as an independent, but I’m doing so with a heavy heart,” he said. “It is my hope that party leaders will eventually sit down and resolve the issues. I would have loved to stand under my party, but the situation on the ground is not conducive.”
Dube said his decision to run for Parliament was informed by the work he has done at ward level and growing calls from constituents for him to expand his impact.
“I have made the decision to run for MP because I have been doing a lot of good work as a councillor for Ward 15, and my voters are telling me I should do even more,” he said.
During his tenure as councillor, Dube said he gained insight into the challenges affecting the broader Insiza North district and is now seeking to address them at a higher level.
“I would like to work with fellow councillors in the constituency and help them develop their areas,” he said. “I want to take that spirit to the constituency and cover all the wards in Insiza North because I’ve done great work in Ward 15.”
If elected, Dube said he will prioritise improving the constituency’s poor infrastructure.
“I will be working hard to bring improvements, because there are no roads, very few schools and clinics, and the infrastructure is generally poor,” he said.
He also disclosed that he will self-fund part of his campaign, but is open to support.
“I am financially secure because I work as a miner in Filabusi, but I am also open to donations from anyone who wishes to help,” said Dube.
He added that he is open to collaborating with members across the political divide if they are committed to development.
“As long as it involves development, I am willing to collaborate with any Member of Parliament,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/councillor-dumps-ccc-to-contest-insiza-north-by-election-as-independent/,2025-05-14 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Ibhetshu LikaZulu remembers the 21 mothers burned alive during Gukurahundi,"This reminder comes as the world celebrated Mother’s Day on 11 May, honouring the sacrifices and love of mothers.
However, for Ibhetshu LikaZulu, the day also brought back devastating memories of how “innocent” women, daughters, and sisters, were slaughtered in a “calculated act of extermination”.
The 1983 massacre in Emkhonyeni stands as one of the most brutal episodes of the Gukurahundi genocide, where an estimated 20 000 civilians were killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade between 1983 and 1987.
The 21 women were reportedly locked in a hut and set ablaze.
Ibhetshu LikaZulu’s Secretary-General, Mbuso Fuzwayo said these women were Sikhangezile Msipha, Deliwe Ndlovu, Concilia Ncube, Sikhathele Ndlovu, Masalu Ndlovu, Senzeni Sibanda, Betty Sibanda, Singatsho Sibanda, Musa Ncube, Elitha Ngwane, Eva Tshuma, and others, who he lamented remain largely absent from Zimbabwe’s official history.
In a statement released on May 11, Fuzwayo, said the commemoration of Mother’s Day must also confront Zimbabwe’s unresolved history of state-sponsored violence, particularly the atrocities committed against women during the Gukurahundi era.
“On this Mother’s Day, Ibhetshu LikaZulu extends heartfelt solidarity and reverence to all mothers in Zimbabwe and across the world,” Fuzwayo said.
“Today, we celebrate the courage, resilience, and unwavering love of mothers who continue to defy all odds to nurture, protect, and provide for their children and families, often under dire circumstances shaped by Zimbabwe’s ongoing economic collapse, a direct result of decades of misrule by the Zanu PF regime.”
He painted a grim picture of the daily struggles Zimbabwean women endure daily while condemning the state’s refusal to acknowledge past atrocities.
“In the face of spiraling inflation, joblessness, and systemic neglect, Zimbabwean mothers stand as the last line of defense against hunger, despair, and family disintegration. They are the ones who wake before dawn, search for food, fetch water from distant boreholes, endure humiliations at hospitals with no medication and walk long distances so their children might learn,” he said. “These women embody the spirit of sacrifice and dignity amidst a monstrous economy that continues to punish the innocent and reward the corrupt.”
Turning to the 21 women, Fuzwayo said “their only ‘crime’ was the potential to give birth to more of those whom the regime sought to annihilate.”
“This calculated and evil act, setting women alight, was not only a gross violation of human rights but a spiritual and generational wound. It robbed children of their mothers. It condemned survivors to lifetimes of unhealed trauma. It created orphans not only in body but in soul,” he said.
Despite decades passing, no official memorial exists, no perpetrator has been prosecuted, and the government’s approach to reconciliation has been widely criticised as superficial.
“This atrocity, one among countless others committed during the Gukurahundi genocide, remains unacknowledged by the very government that carried it out. There has been no remorse. No memorialisation. No justice,” Fuzwayo lamented.
“Instead, we witness attempts to sanitise the past through choreographed ‘reconciliation’ processes that serve only the political elite, while survivors are re-traumatized and excluded. These are side shows. These are spectacles of deceit. They are profiteering ventures cloaked in the language of peace, while the truth lies buried, both literally and metaphorically, in shallow graves and silenced testimonies.”
On Mother’s Day, Ibhetshu LikaZulu did not merely call for remembrance, but for tangible action.
“We demand: A full and public acknowledgment of the Emkhonyeni massacre and all Gukurahundi atrocities; A survivor-centered truth-telling and reconciliation process, independent of government manipulation; Justice for the families of the victims and Memorialisation of the women who died, whose names and stories must be etched into the national conscience.”
Fuzwayo concluded with a rallying cry for truth and justice.
“Let this day not pass as mere sentiment. Let it be a rallying cry for justice, dignity, and remembrance. We honour not only the nurturing hands of mothers but the blood of the fallen. We will not forget. We will not be silenced,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/ibhetshu-likazulu-remembers-the-21-mothers-burned-alive-during-gukurahundi/,2025-05-14 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Tracking Donald Trump's indictments,"Donald Trump's criminal cases, in one place
President-elect Donald Trump will face no legal penalties for his conviction in the hush money case. Judge Juan Merchan upheld Trump’s conviction in the case on January 3, 2025, rejecting the president-elect’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his reelection in November. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.
Previously, special counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25 that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump. While Smith is dropping his prosecution of Trump, he said that prosecutors would keep alive their case against two of his employees in the classified documents case.
Since Trump’s reelection, Smith had been in talks with Justice Department leadership about how to end both cases. Trump has said he would fire Smith once he retook the office, shattering previous norms around special counsel investigations.
On September 12, some charges in the Fulton County case were thrown out by the judge.

Summary
Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. On May 30, 2024 he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree by 12 jurors. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further, they alleged he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including the $130,000 payment. Trump pleaded not guilty.
On November 19, 2024, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told Judge Juan Merchan it would agree to delay Trump’s sentencing, which had been set for November 26, to allow time for the anticipated litigation around the president-elect’s expected motion to dismiss the case. On November 22, Merchan indefinitely postponed the sentencing and granted Trump’s request to file a motion to dismiss the case. On January 3, 2025, Merchan rejected Trump's effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his reelection in November and upheld the conviction. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.

Summary
Trump was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. Both Trump and his aide Walt Nauta have pleaded not guilty.
On July 27, 2023, the special counsel charged Trump with three new counts, including one additional count of willful retention of national defense information. Nauta was also charged on two new counts. A third defendant, Carlos de Oliveira, was added to the case and charged with four counts, including being added to the obstruction conspiracy charged in the original indictment.
US District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on July 15, 2024, saying in a ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution.

Summary
Special counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25, 2024, that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.
Smith had filed a superseding indictment on August 27 in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped. In the reworked indictment, prosecutors argue several times that Trump didn't have any constitutionally assigned presidential duties regarding the post-election transition of power. In one instance, prosecutors pointed to the Electoral College certification proceedings that took place during a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021. The criminal charges in part accuse Trump of illegally obstructing the certification proceeding. The Trump campaign has previously denied the allegations and Trump pleaded not guilty to all four counts.
On February 6, 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. On July 1, the Supreme Court rejected that decision, ruling that Trump can claim limited immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken in office — likely further delaying a trial in the case.
On Oct. 2, 2024, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., released a 165-page filing from Smith in which the special counsel argues that Trump acted to overturn the election in his private capacity as a candidate, rather than in his official capacity as a president. The document, which offers the fullest account of the special counsel's evidence, lays out the prosecution's case for a trial judge in a way that they believe would overcome the immunity protections around the presidency that the Supreme Court outlined.
The initial charging documents repeatedly reference six co-conspirators, but as is common practice, their identities were withheld because they have not been charged with any crimes. However, based on quotes in the indictment and other context, CNN can identify five of the six co-conspirators below.
Charges
Key evidence
A January 2, 2021, phone call between then-President Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where Trump “lied” in an attempt “to induce him” to overturn the election and find the exact number of votes to flip his defeat in Georgia, prosecutors said in the indictment.
Key people
People involved
Rudy Giuliani
A former Trump lawyer and former mayor of New York City. The indictment quotes from a voicemail that Co-Conspirator 1 left “for a United States Senator” on January 6, 2021, which match quotes from Giuliani’s call intended for GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, as reported by CNN and other outlets. Ted Goodman, a political adviser to Giuliani, said in a statement that “every fact Mayor Rudy Giuliani possesses about this case establishes the good faith basis President Donald Trump had for the actions he took.”
John Eastman
A former Trump lawyer. The indictment says Co-Conspirator 2 “circulated a two-page memorandum” with a plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election. Quotes from the memo match a two-page document that Eastman wrote, as reported and published by CNN. Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, said the indictment “relies on a misleading presentation of the record,” and that his client would decline a plea deal if offered one.
Sidney Powell
A former Trump lawyer. The indictment says Co-Conspirator 3 “filed a lawsuit against the Governor of Georgia” on November 25, 2020, alleging “massive election fraud,” which match the federal lawsuit that Powell filed against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. An attorney for Powell declined to comment.
Jeffrey Clark
A former Justice Department official. The indictment quotes an email that a top Justice Department official sent to Clark, rebutting Clark’s attempts to use the department to overturn the election as previously identified in a Senate report about how Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department in 2020. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Clark.
Kenneth Chesebro
A pro-Trump lawyer. The indictment references an “email memorandum” that Co-Conspirator 5 “sent” to Co-Conspirator 1 on December 13, 2020, about the fake electors plot. The email matches an email that Chesebro sent to Giuliani, according to a copy made public by the House select committee that investigated January 6. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Chesebro.
Co-Conspirator 6
The indictment says they are “a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.” The indictment also further ties this person to the fake elector slate in Pennsylvania.

Summary
An Atlanta-based grand jury on August 14, 2023, indicted Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former president’s 2020 electoral defeat. Four people have pleaded guilty.
The historic indictment is the fourth criminal case that Trump is facing. The charges, brought in a sweeping investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, cover some of the most overt efforts by the former president and his allies to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. Unlike the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, Willis’ case will be insulated if Trump is reelected in 2024; he will not be able to pardon himself or his allies of any state law convictions, nor will he be able to order the state-level prosecutors to withdraw the charges. Trump pleaded not guilty via court filing, waiving an in-court appearance as allowed by Georgia law.
On March 13, 2024, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee dismissed six of the 41 counts from the indictment, including three that applied to Trump. The partial dismissal does not mean that the entire indictment has been dismissed. McAfee’s partial dismissal left most of the sprawling racketeering indictment intact.
On June 5, a Georgia appeals court indefinitely paused the case for Trump and some co-defendants until a panel of judges rules on whether Willis should be disqualified.
On September 12, some of the charges were thrown out by the judge.
Charges
Use the arrows to see the full list of charges.
Key evidence
The indictment document includes Trump’s notorious phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger when he asked Raffensperger to “find” the votes he needed to win the state, the fake elector scheme and a September 2021 letter he sent to Raffensperger again urging him to decertify the state’s 2020 vote.
CNN has previously reported that surveillance video, text messages and other communications unearthed during a civil case provided essential evidence for prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

Mnangagwa pardons ailing former judge who fled after corruption conviction,"HARARE – President Emmerson Mnangagwa has pardoned former High Court judge Benjamin Paradza who was convicted on corruption charges but fled the country before sentencing in 2006.
Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi announced the full pardon in a Government Gazette published on May 23.
The notice said: “It is hereby notified that His Excellency the President has in terms of section 112(1)(a) and (b) of the constitution, made an order granting pardon for Mr Benjamin Paradza in respect of his conviction (Case Number CRB 152/2004) on two counts of corruption on the 9th January, 2006, by the High Court of Zimbabwe sitting at Harare.”
Paradza, who was admitted as a lawyer by the New Zealand Bar in 2011, is reportedly suffering from a terminal illness and his family has lobbied the government to allow him to return home.
A source familiar with the discussions said: “He is ill and elderly and a war veteran. He needs to be taken care of by his family here.
“If he returns home with that conviction hanging over his head it means he has to be immediately arrested, and it would be actually expensive to incarcerate him because of his medical needs.”
Paradza was tried after he approached three judges – Justice Maphios Cheda, Justice George Chiweshe and Justice Lawrence Kamocha trying to get them to release the passport of his business associate Russell Wayne Labuschagne, who was facing murder allegations.
It was Justice Cheda who caused his arrest after making a secret recording of Paradza stating that Labuschagne, who was eventually jailed 15 years by Kamocha over the death of man who allegedly trespassed into his fish farm in Kariba, needed to attend a convention for professional hunters in the United States.
Paradza told Cheda that he and his partners in Circle G, which was part of the Midland Black Rhino Conservancy in Kwekwe, stood to make US$60,000 if Labuschagne travelled to the United States and clinched deals with hunters.
Cheda also told the trial that he was approached by a Mr Anand who offered him a bribe.
Paradza pleaded his innocence, insisting that he only asked the judges to take a look at the file and exercise their discretion if Labuschagne’s application for a variation of his bail terms, namely the release of his passport held by the Clerk of Court, came before them.
He instead claimed the judges had been sent to trap him because he had passed judgments which were unfavourable to the government.
The pardon means Paradza will never be sentenced.

Police under fire over fresh allegations of brutality and abuse,"By Promise Dube
Human rights lawyer Arnold Tsunga says these cases reflect a disturbing pattern of abuse by law enforcement officers against civilians, vendors, and even learners, warning that impunity remains a central problem.
In March, nearly 100 people were arrested during protests in Harare. According to Tsunga, most of those detained were not involved in the demonstration but were picked up while commuting home from work.
“When they appeared in court, it became clear that the majority had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Tsunga said . “Detaining people in such circumstances under filthy conditions amounts to abuse of police power.”
Public anger has also been fuelled by the death of 30-year-old Blessed Believe Juruvenge, who died after allegedly being severely beaten by Constable Prince Ndavambi while in police custody at Ruwa Police Station last month.
Ndavambi reportedly assaulted Juruvenge with a hoe handle, while fellow officers allegedly watched without intervening. After weeks on the run, Ndavambi was arrested on 12 June.
In a separate incident in Maphisa, Matabeleland South, police conducting a crime awareness campaign at Mahetshe Primary School reportedly beat several pupils, including toddlers, sparking national outcry.
Witnesses said uniformed officers slapped and caned the learners, leaving some injured and in tears. Parents and rights groups have condemned the incident as unlawful and degrading, prompting a government investigation.
“The police are not mandated to discipline schoolchildren,” Tsunga said, describing the incident as a gross abuse of authority.
The fresh allegations have revived memories of Zimbabwe’s post-election violence in 2018, when soldiers opened fire on protesters in Harare, killing six people. Despite a commission of inquiry led by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe recommending prosecutions, no action has been taken against those responsible.
“These cases demonstrate a systematic failure to hold security forces accountable,” Tsunga said. “There is a clear pattern of excessive and unlawful force, which fosters public fear and distrust.”
He urged the police to adhere strictly to principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, and accountability in maintaining public order.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/police-under-fire-over-fresh-allegations-of-brutality-and-abuse/,2025-06-13 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Gukurahundi hearings to be held in private as media barred,"Deputy President of the National Council of Chiefs, Chief Fortune Charumbira, told a press conference in Bulawayo that the process will follow a victim-centred approach to safeguard the dignity, safety and privacy of survivors of the 1980s atrocities.
“Our approach is victim-centred. These are not public hearings,” he said. “Because of the sensitivities involved and the private nature of some of the testimonies, such accounts cannot be shared openly.”
He stressed that even multiple victims from the same community would not appear together. Instead, each will be seen individually by a 14-member local panel, led by the area’s chief, with time slots arranged to ensure privacy.
“Victims will appear one at a time. A chief may, for example, hear one victim in the morning and another in the afternoon. Victims may only bring one or two close family members if they wish,” Charumbira said.
The hearings will be overseen by local chiefs supported by a panel comprising elders, religious leaders, youth and women’s representatives, as well as counselling experts, all drawn from the chief’s jurisdiction to maintain cultural sensitivity.
When asked if victims could choose to speak to the media outside the hearings, Charumbira firmly replied: “No.”
He explained that the restriction was intended to prevent re-traumatisation and social stigma for victims whose accounts may expose deeply personal or painful experiences.
“These are private matters. Like certain court cases held in camera, these hearings are confidential to protect the victim’s well-being,” he said.
Charumbira revealed that previous efforts to agree on media access guidelines with government and journalists had stalled.
“We met with the Ministry of Information to explore media involvement, and the media fraternity was tasked to propose a code of conduct. To date, no such framework has been submitted,” he said.
Despite this, Charumbira insisted that media attendance would remain inappropriate given the sensitivity of the proceedings.
“Some revelations could damage a victim’s standing in the community forever. We cannot risk that,” he warned. “Even if media were to be excluded after the fact, information might already be leaked or misused.”
Responding to concerns that barring the media contradicts the principle of transparency, Charumbira argued that openness lies in providing victims with a safe platform to speak.
“The openness is to the victims, not the public. The public will be informed through official briefings. What is important is the final report, not individual stories,” he said.
Charumbira assured journalists that the National Council of Chiefs would issue periodic updates on the hearings’ progress.
“Regular media briefings will be held by the President of the Council of Chiefs to keep the public informed,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/gukurahundi-hearings-to-be-held-in-private-as-media-barred/,2025-06-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,
"Zanu PF sweeps Insiza, Gutu by-elections amid CCC boycott & voter apathy","According to official results released by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), Delani Moyo of Zanu PF emerged victorious in Insiza North with 7,171 votes, significantly outpacing his closest rival, independent candidate Leslie Dube, who garnered 1,187 votes. Other contenders included ZNRP’s Mbongeni Moyo with 131 votes and ZAPU’s Thabani Mlotshwa, who received 114.
ZEC’s declaration, signed by the constituency elections officer on 14 June, confirmed Moyo as the duly elected Member of Parliament for Insiza North. There was a low voter turnout which stood at 35.9%, with 84 ballots rejected.
In Gutu East, Zanu PF’s Zarevashe Masvingise also secured a landslide victory. There were 194 votes rejected while the voter turnout stood at 48.3%. The result further consolidates Zanu PF’s parliamentary dominance.
The CCC, once Zimbabwe’s main opposition force, did not field candidates in either race, maintaining its boycott of electoral processes it alleges are rigged in favour of the governing Zanu PF.

How 2024 exit polls compare with the 2020 and 2016 elections,"President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidency for a second time in a historic comeback. There are some key takeaways in how the country’s politics have shifted over three straight elections with Trump on the ballot.
CNN’s exit poll results from 2016, 2020 and 2024 reveal how a sour economy was a drag on Vice President Kamala Harris, how she failed to drive an uptick in support among women even though there was an uptick in support for abortion rights, and how Latino men, in particular, gravitated toward Trump.
CNN's exit polls for the 2024 general election include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year's election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the election themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they're most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That's particularly true before the exit poll numbers are adjusted to match final election results.
Exit poll data for 2024 will continue to update and will automatically reflect in the charts below.
Women lean toward Harris, and men lean toward Trump
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Gender
Harris’ edge among women this year did not exceed either President Joe Biden’s or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s, a troubling sign for the vice president given that she tried to mobilize female voters on the issue of abortion. Trump maintained an edge among men.
Latino men embraced Trump
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Race/ethnicity and gender
Latino voters, and men in particular, have been moving toward Trump since 2016. This year, Latino men broke in his direction for the first time. Biden won their support by 23 points in 2020 and Trump won them in 2024. Latina women still favored Harris, but by smaller margins than they supported either Clinton or Biden.
Harris maintained strong leads among Black men and women. Trump’s lead among White men shrank.
The educational divide grows
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Education, race and gender
White voters without college degrees have long represented Trump’s base of support, something that has remained constant. A shift has occurred among White college-educated voters. They narrowly backed Trump in 2016, but Harris won them in 2024, a split driven by both men and women. Harris won White women with a college degree by about 15 points — an improvement over both Biden and Clinton. Meanwhile, Harris lost some support among voters of color of all education levels.
Younger voters shifted toward Trump, while he lost ground with senior voters
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Age
Democrats lost some support among the youngest voters, a group that overwhelmingly votes for them. But Harris also made gains among the oldest voters, a group that traditionally leans Republican. It’s an interesting shift.
Trump regained power in rural America
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Where voters live
While Trump lost some support in rural areas in 2020, he returned to full strength there in 2024. Cities remained solidly Democratic. The suburbs stayed the evenly split battleground that decides elections.
Voters are sour on the economy
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
View of the economy
Voters were about evenly split in 2020 on whether the economy was in good shape or not, an incredible thing given the raging pandemic that was affecting Americans’ lives that year. In 2024, about two-thirds of voters said the economy was in bad shape. That shift in sentiment benefited Trump.
More people report their family has fallen behind
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Family’s financial situation today
It makes sense that partisans would say their position has or has not improved based on whether the person they support is in the White House. This year, there’s a big shift. In 2020, just about one-fifth of voters said they were doing worse than four years before. This year, it’s nearly half of voters who say they are doing worse than four years ago. Trump won them overwhelmingly.
More Americans support abortion rights
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Abortion should be:
One story these charts don’t fully tell is how the abortion conversation has changed. In 2016, Roe v. Wade guaranteed every American woman a constitutional right to an abortion. In 2024, that federal right is gone, taken away by a conservative majority Trump helped seat on the Supreme Court. In 2020, about half of Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In 2024, it’s about two-thirds of Americans who say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But they didn’t necessarily tie that support to their vote for president. About half of people who say abortion should be legal in most cases supported Trump.
Trump made inroads with moderates
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Ideology
Liberals and conservatives have moved even further into their partisan corners during the Trump years. Moderates still favored the Democratic nominee in 2024, but by a smaller margin than in 2020.
Trump is the dominant figure in the election
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Vote for president mainly:
People who say they cast their vote more in support of their chosen candidate than against their opponent split for Trump, a signal of his popularity among his supporters. Those motivated more by opposition were largely in Harris’ camp. Overall, roughly three-quarters of voters said they were mostly voting to support their candidate, not to oppose their rival.
Trump engaged new voters
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
First-year voters
Trump’s campaign strategy was built around motivating low-propensity voters who don’t usually take part in the political process. That paid off because there was a dramatic swing between 2020, when Biden won first-year voters, and 2024, when Trump won them. But there’s important context in the fact that a smaller portion of voters reported casting their first ballot in 2024 than in 2020.
CNN exit polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. They were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 279 polling locations. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted between October 24 and November 2, in person at 27 early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 22,914 respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/,2024-11-06 00:00:00,cnn,politics,"CNN,Zachary B.

CCC MPs refuse to ‘protect and secure’ Mnangagwa’s Belarus deals,"HARARE – President Emmerson Mnangagwa presided over the signing of several Memorandum of Understanding with Belarus in Minsk on Tuesday, but opposition legislators refused to approve an agreement meant to “protect and secure” Belarusian investments in Zimbabwe.
Sheila Chikomo, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, presented the memorandum of agreement in the National Assembly seeking ratification of the agreement on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments.
She said parliament should approve the agreement by May 31, 2025.
President Mnangagwa signed the agreement in 2023 but it does not bind Zimbabwe until it has been approved by parliament.
A parliamentary committee on foreign affairs also recommended that the agreement be approved because it presents a significant opportunity for Zimbabwe to promote investment, foster sustainable development and strengthen economic ties.
Opposition Citizens Coalition for Change MPs voiced disquiet.
“The coincidence of the minister bringing this agreement before this August House was designed to be timed with the president’s official visit currently happening,” said Edwin Mushoriwa, MP for Dzivarasekwa.
Mushoriwa said parliament cannot approve the agreement without full information on the balance of trade between Belarus and Zimbabwe.
“We also need to be worried when we end up having a trade agreement which can be manipulated and exploited by few individuals who are connected.”
Mbizo MP Corban Madziwanyika said the agreement would only benefit Belarus since Zimbabwe will only be importing finished products including tractors.
Another MP Mutsa Murombedzi said “parliament should not become a rubber stamp for executive deals.”
“It’s a document that potentially grants disapproportionate power to foreign capital with little accountability. I therefore call upon this house to defer the approval,” she said.
Zanu PF MPs among them Supa Mandiwanzira vociferously pushed for the agreement’s approval.

ANC Urged To Expel Geza Over Alleged Zimbabwe Destabilisation Plot,"According to The NewsHawks, Nyekorach-Matsanga has long been known as a staunch ZANU-PF supporter and public relations operative, having previously worked as a propagandist for Zimbabwe’s ruling party during the late President Robert Mugabe’s tenure.
In a letter dated 18 May and addressed to ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, Nyekorach-Matsanga urged the South African government to expel Geza.
He accused Geza of using South African territory as a base to launch attacks against Zimbabwe’s leadership, claiming that such activities undermine regional peace and security in contravention of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), African Union (AU), and United Nations (UN) treaties and protocols.
Titled “Urgent Legal and Diplomatic Concerns Regarding Activities of one Bombshell Geza and Associated Groups Operating from South African Soil,” the letter alleges that Geza is at the centre of a wider network of political groups, activists, NGOs, and digital media platforms.
This network, it claims, is orchestrating a coordinated “campaign of destabilisation” targeting President Emmerson Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF, and the Zimbabwean government. Part of the letter reads:
We write oo behalf of the Pan African Forum Limited & Associates, a continental advocacy and legal policy platform, to express our grave concern regarding the continued use of South Africa soil, particularly under the ANC-led government, as a staging ground for regime change activities targeting the sovereign Republic of Zimbabwe.
We have gathered credible intelligence and evidence indicating that one Bombshell Geza and a network of foreign-sponsored actors are actively operating from South Africa, utilising non-governmental organisations, digital media platforms, and political networks to coordinate a destabilisation campaign against the ruling party in Zimbabwe, ZANU PF, and President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration.
These operations, which include digital disinformation warfare and mobilisation of protest strategies, constitute a direct violation of regional and international law. This is where our specialty is.
Our legal and diplomatic concerns in the conduct of these actors that contravene Article 4(c) of the SADC Treaty, which upholds non-interference in the internal affairs of member states.
Their actions further breach the African Union Constitutive Act1, Articles 3(b) and (g), on sovereign respect and condemnation of unconstitutional changes of government.
South Africa’s inaction may amount to a violation of its obligations under the United Nations Charter, Article 2(4), as well as its own domestic legal instruments, including the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorism Act.
Nyekorach-Matsanga urged South Africa and the ANC to uphold Pan-African solidarity and respect for national sovereignty. He said:
We request ANC to co-operate with the Government of Zimbabwe and SADC regional mechanisms to ensure South African territory is not used for the destabilisation of a fellow member state.We however, state here that we are not acting on the instructions of Zimbabwe Government but we the watch tower of Africa.
Just like South Africa went to (International Court of Justice) ICJ for Human Rights abuses in Gaza by Israel, we have acted on behalf of better Africa.
We must add that failure to act on this matter risks eroding the integrity of SADC, undermining the credibility of the ANC as a Pan-African liberation movement, and encouraging further external manipulation of African political systems.
We are prepared to initiate a formal submission to the African Union Peace and Security Council and the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation if this matter is not addressed expeditiously.
Geza, a war veteran and member of ZANU PF’s Central Committee, is wanted by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) on a range of criminal charges.
These include the alleged theft of three motor vehicles, which were reportedly taken and disposed of without the owner’s consent.
He is also accused of undermining the authority of, or insulting, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, an offence under Zimbabwe’s Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, as well as inciting public violence, particularly in connection with his calls for a national shutdown in protest against the country’s worsening economic conditions.
Geza has been an outspoken critic of Mnangagwa’s administration, accusing it of corruption and gross economic mismanagement.

Here’s what Trump has promised to do in a second term,"Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks. The former president has also talked about reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, from 21% – but only for companies that make their products in the US.
“I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history,” the former president said earlier this year at the Black Conservative Federation’s Honors Gala in South Carolina. “We’ll make it permanent and give you a new economic boom.”
I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history.”
In September, Trump said he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.
“That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said at a rally in Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”
This summer, during a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Trump also pledged to end taxes on tips, a move targeted to appeal to hundreds of thousands of people working in the city. It’s a promise Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News in a November 10 interview that he plans to implement on Day One.
The former president has also promised to stop taxing Social Security benefits. He has yet to outline a proposal to replace the lost revenue, which could harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget.
He announced in November that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump had previously proposed as a way to reduce government spending. The commission will “develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months,” Trump said in September remarks at the Economic Club of New York.
The former president has also announced plans to get rid of the $10,000 limit on state and local tax, or SALT, deductions that he signed into law as part of his 2017 tax cuts. Reversing this cap would largely affect higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions.
In an early October speech, Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible. He also vowed in an October video to end the double taxation on Americans who live abroad. This move could stop some Americans living abroad from having to pay taxes to both the US and to the country where they live. He has not provided details on how such relief would work.
Trump has also pledged to repeal Biden’s tax hikes, “immediately tackle” inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. He has promised to rescind all unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which put in place a wide array of climate measures and funneled about $80 billion over 10 years to the Internal Revenue Service.
In an effort to address housing affordability, Trump has floated a ban on mortgages for undocumented immigrants, claiming that they push up housing costs. CNN has reported that undocumented immigrants, however, make up a tiny portion of the mortgage market.
To help “working Americans” catch up on credit card debt, Trump promised in September to temporarily cap interest rates on credit cards at 10%. The average credit card rate is just under 21%, while the average rate on retail store cards is a record high 30.45%.
At a late October rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he also said he would support a tax credit for family caregivers. He has not outlined details about who would be eligible, how large it would be and whether the cost would be covered.
In February, Trump pledged to impose “stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.”
“It’s called you screw us, and we screw you,” Trump said at a South Carolina rally.
Under his proposed “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,” the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose “a reciprocal, identical” tariff right back.
It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs.
It’s called you screw us, and we screw you.”
As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called “America First” trade agenda. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and stop China from buying up America and US companies from investing in China.
Since winning the election, Trump has promised to put a new 25% tariff on all products coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods by 10%, on the first day of his administration -- in retaliation for illegal immigration and drugs coming across the border. On January 14, 2025, Trump said he will create an “External Revenue Service” on Day One of his presidency to collect tariffs and all revenue from “foreign sources.”
At one point earlier this year, Trump had said he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He has also called for adding a tariff of at least 10% on all imports from all countries. At an August campaign event in North Carolina, he suggested that the across-the-board tariff could be as high as 20%.
In September, Trump floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico. He claimed this would stop Chinese companies from building auto plants in Mexico as a way to avoid US tariffs, which he could impose by executive action.
Trump has also repeatedly expressed interest in ending the federal income tax, pointing to the late 19th century, when the US relied on tariffs to fund federal spending.
“When we were a smart country, in the 1890s … this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said in late October.
Earlier in October, Trump announced he would invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was signed into law in January 2020 as a replacement for NAFTA.
The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. “Economic security is national security,” he said.
Trump made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border in February, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.
In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the “Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.”
“We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,” he wrote.
In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” a plan Trump has said he’d launch on Day One in the White House.
We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.”
In October, Trump said he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to create a federal program to expedite the removal of undocumented gang members. He also warned that ""if they come back into our country, they will be told it is an automatic 10-year sentence in jail with no possibility of parole.” CNN has reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement already deports individuals who pose a national security or public safety threat once ordered removed by an immigration judge.
Later that month, Trump promised to create a “compensation fund” for victims of crimes committed by migrants by using assets seized from gangs and drug cartels.
Also in October, during a rally in Arizona, Trump promised to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents, provide a 10% salary raise and offer a $10,000 retention and signing bonus. His comments came months after Senate Republicans, at his urging, blocked a bipartisan border measure that would have cleared the way for more Border Patrol agents.
Separately, last summer, Trump proposed “automatically” giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges — comments that break from his efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration while in office. In May 2024, Trump said that on Day One of his presidency he would issue an executive order, “making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward,“ children born to undocumented immigrants would not automatically gain US citizenship.
After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of “Hamas’ sympathizers.”
“We’ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that’s OK with you,” he added.
Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republican senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.
“Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,” he said.
“It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,” he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. But when asked during September’s debate with Harris about whether he has a plan to replace Obamacare, he replied, “I have concepts of a plan.”
Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration.”
Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president’s pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.
On the abortion issue, Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that laws should be decided by states.
“The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in an April recording posted to his Truth Social platform.
Trump also said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions.
In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for.
Since winning the election, Trump said he’ll nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pushed vaccine conspiracy theories, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump had said in late October that he’d let his former political rival “go wild on health.”
Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing “radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.”
“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump said in June 2023 remarks. “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.”
Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove “rogue” bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress.
I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”
To address what he labeled the “disturbing” relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data.
Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from “colluding” to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in “censorship-supporting activities.”
In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council’s Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges.
“I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,” he said.
Trump has also pledged to “appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.”
In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been “unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.” Trump noted that he wanted to “study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.”
It’s a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection on the US Capitol, which he has repeatedly pledged that he would execute on Day One (though it’s not clear who among the hundreds of convicted rioters, defendants awaiting trial and remaining fugitives would receive clemency, CNN has reported).
At the Libertarian Convention in May, Trump also promised to release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the online black market Silk Road who is serving a life sentence in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking. Trump declined to commute Ulbricht’s sentence during his presidency.
*Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns
Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases.
“We’re going to ‘drill, baby, drill’ right away,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, in January, a refrain he repeated often on the campaign trail throughout 2024.
At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports.
Trump said in a January 6, 2025 interview he would try to undo on Day One an action that President Joe Biden took to permanently ban future offshore oil and gas development in parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Biden’s action invoked the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act -- a law that gives presidents broad authority to withdraw federal waters from future oil and gas development and that doesn’t explicitly allow presidents to use actions to put waters back into development. Trump would need Congress to change that law before he could act on his proposed reversal.
The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign.
As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.”
In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on Day One.”
Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive because servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions in order to receive the cryptocurrency as a reward.
At a cryptocurrency conference in July, the former president promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US.
“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said, adding that he would create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.”
On the campaign trail, he also vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has pushed to regulate the industry. Gensler has said he’ll step down on January 20, 2025, which made room for the president-elect to announce he will select Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, to run the agency.",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/trump-campaign-promises-dg/,2025-01-15 00:00:00,cnn,politics,CNN

The Chaona massacre of 2008,"By Ngoni Danzva
The militia members belonged to different terror gangs, but notable ones were from the Border Gezi group, who wore an olive green uniform, and others from the Paraquat they wore T Shirts inscribed “Paraquat”, a gang that belonged to Saviour Kasukuwere. But on the day of the attack on Chaona villagers, the groups were led by and under the command of Retired Major General Cairo Mhandu, a former soldier.
They camped at Chaona Primary School in preparation for a brutal assault on innocent civilians the next day. The brutality that followed had to be seen to be believed.
Major General Mhandu instructed his thugs to spread a message to the villagers, ordering anyone and everyone to be at Chaona Primary School by 5 a.m. The villagers were threatened with violence and arson attacks should they fail to show up at the meeting.
The next day, on the 5th of May 2008, villagers across Chiweshe arrived at Chaona Primary School. Fearing for their lives, they had to show up. And to some, this would be their last day alive.
When the villagers finally gathered at Chaona Primary School, Mhandu told the crowd that “this community needs to be taught a lesson.” He ordered the villagers that they must come forward and confess their links and association with the opposition.
The crowd was terrified, and no one stepped forward. After a brief moment of silence, ZANU PF youths grabbed a 76-year-old woman from the crowd and ordered her to lie in front of the crowd on her stomach. They started beating her with sjamboks and sticks on her buttocks. After some minutes, three men came forward and said they were opposition supporters, just to save the old lady from the beatings.
What ensued next was an egregious frenzy of brutality. Over 70 villagers were indiscriminately and severely beaten. Grown men and women groaned in unspeakable pain, cried, and begged for mercy. But no one listened. Their crime was that they had voted for the opposition on the 29th of March general election. It was also a terror campaign intended to discourage them from voting for the opposition in the run-off election, which was scheduled to take place on Friday the 27th of June 2008.
Six men tragically died from the brutal beatings and torture that took place that day. Two of them, Tapiwa Meda and Alex Chirisiri, died on the spot after the beatings. Joseph Madzuramhende died later that day after they had squeezed and crushed his genitals, tying them with a wire. Geoffrey Jemedze and Wilson Emmanuel died at Avenues Clinic on Friday the 9th of May 2008. Fushirai Dofu died on Saturday the 10th of May 2008 at Howard Hospital.
😔
Not only were six murders committed, but also over 30 attempted murders of people who were hospitalized at Howard Hospital, Concession Hospital, and Avenues Clinic. Tens of cases of grievous bodily harm were also committed during the torture sessions.
5 May 2025 marked exactly 17 years since the Chaona attack. No investigations were conducted, and no arrests were made by the Zimbabwe Republic Police for the crimes against humanity that were committed in Chiweshe.
No one was ever brought to justice for the deaths of Joseph Madzuramhende, Tapiwa Meda, Alex Chirisiri, Geoffrey Jemedze, Wilson Emmanuel, and Fushirai Dofu.
Rest in peace, dear comrades. You paid the ultimate price for a noble cause to see a free Zimbabwe, and your names shall forever be inscribed on the corridors of history. You are not forgotten.

Key points
All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable
When audiences use BBC Online, they need to be confident that our decisions on links and feeds are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests.
A link must never be included on the Public Service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.
An external site which is a candidate for a link should, generally, be relevant to the BBC content from which a link is envisaged; meet the expectations of the likely audience.
The producer must check the contents of the external site before adding a link to a BBC page.
In order to maintain impartiality, BBC sites which cover matters of controversy or public policy may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject.
For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme’s viewers and listeners.
When linking to any commercial site, great care must be taken to avoid giving the impression that the BBC is endorsing a commercial product or service.
Links from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC’s Commercial sites are acceptable only when clearly editorially justified.
It is likely to be editorially justifiable to link directly to the source of tickets if the event for which the tickets are being sold is a BBC Event. If not, a link to eg the band’s own site would be editorially justifiable, from where a user can click to the ticket agency’s site.
Before offering automatically generated links to external sites from BBC content, a number of factors should be considered, including the genre of editorial content, the ability to select from appropriate recognised and reputable sources and how to remove links from specific stories quickly.
Pulling third party feeds onto BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally, because users are more likely to expect the feeds to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards.
The person responsible for the page on which a feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed.
When we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about this with our users.
We should be clear about what our users can do and where they should go if they see a mistake or find something offensive.
It should be clear to a casual user that an inbound embed (for example, of video from a social networking site) is not under the editorial control of the BBC and is not primarily the responsibility of the BBC. But we are responsible for deciding what non-BBC content to embed on BBC pages and we should be alert to the possibility of the original content being changed or removed and to rights issues.

Introduction
The BBC’s global reputation is based on its editorial integrity and independence. Our audiences need to be confident that our decisions are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests. We must not undermine these values by any actions which could bring the BBC into disrepute.
The Editorial Guidelines state that:
our impartiality, editorial integrity and independence must not be compromised by outside interests and arrangements we must maintain independent editorial control over our content
we must not give undue prominence to products, services or trade marks, though we can refer to them and credit them where it is editorially justified
The BBC will not accept product placement on its UK Public Services, and Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services, trade marks, activities or opinions. While our Commercial Services must not promote products, services and trade marks in their content, they can make reference to another organisation, its products, services, trade marks or activities as part of a commercial arrangement. If they do, they must follow the guidelines on product placement, and on advertising and sponsorship which explain that it is not appropriate to make deals with some types of organisation.
on air and online credits must be clearly editorially justified
(See also Editorial Guidelines Section 14: Independence from External Interests: Introduction 14.1 and Logos and Credits Online 14.3.21)
Links to external sites
Whenever producers are creating content on a BBC site, they should actively consider which external websites it may be editorially justifiable to link to.
Editorial justification for linking to external sites
Producers may wish to offer links to external sites for a number of reasons, including:
for further relevant information
for further background information or other key source material
for useful practical information
for further informed comment
A link must never be included on the public service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.
All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable and suitable for the intended audience – particularly children.
Links are not acceptable as a form of credit.
Editorial checks
Producers must check the contents of the site which is signposted before adding a link to a BBC page, although responsibility for including the link lies with the relevant editor.
Where this is practical, we should consider ways to make it easy for users who find broken, stale or inappropriate external BBC links to report these to us so that we can check, update, replace or remove them.
Disclaimers
Where we publish a list of links we should add the standard disclaimer to the effect that ""the BBC is not responsible for the contents of any other sites listed"". If the links are to controversial or challenging material, it may be appropriate to add a specific disclaimer and more information, closer to the links, even when there are only one or two links on a page. For “in story” links to such material, for example to very sensitive content such as a gruelling account of torture, it may be helpful to alert the user to this, in context, as part of telling the story.
Links to sites which do not share BBC editorial values
Context is important in deciding whether a link is appropriate and it is often useful to explain why we are offering the link. In some cases we may offer a link to a site which does not share our editorial values, but which offers a useful insight. For example we might link from a current affairs page to the site of a government-run national news agency so that the user can see the precise words used in a government statement.
Controversial content
We must be duly impartial. BBC sites which cover a controversial or public policy matter may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject. We should ensure that when we link to third party sites that we take into account any concerns about potential breaches of the law, for example, defamation or incitement to racial hatred.
Where content is likely to cause serious offence to some users and yet there is a strong editorial justification for covering the story, it may be editorially justifiable for the BBC to link to the relevant site rather than to host the content ourselves.
Charities
Links to charity sites have to be based on sensible editorial criteria. If one charity is in the news, it may be appropriate to establish a link to the site of that charity. But we must take care not to promote one charity above another. If we are giving advice or general information about the subject and wish to refer to a charity and there is a range of charities working in the field, we should normally link to the other significant charities working in the field as well. This guidance applies to online links offered by BBC Action Lines.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: BBC Support Services 14.3.26)
We should also consider where on the charity website we link to – for example it may be appropriate to link to useful sources of information, but not to campaigning or fundraising pages.
Programme Support
For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's viewers and listeners. If we give a link to an outside advice agency from a support page, we should give links to a reasonable range of other relevant agencies as well.
Where a consumer programme reviews a product or service, we should only offer links to the sites of the manufacturers, suppliers or retailers of any goods or services mentioned where strictly editorially justifiable.
Undue prominence
There must be no undue prominence of products, services or trade marks in our content.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Product Prominence 14.3.1)
Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services or trademarks, so great care must be taken when linking to any site in order not to give the impression that the BBC is doing so.
BBC Public Service sites should not normally link direct to pages whose main purpose is transactional e.g. selling merchandise, downloads or tickets.
See exceptions below for links to buy BBC-related programme content and links to buy tickets for BBC Events. There are some occasions where we may also wish to link directly to a donations page for a BBC charitable appeal.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Charities 16.3.43)
If in any doubt, refer to Editorial Policy.
Links from BBC Public Services to the BBC’s Commercial sites
General points:
Links from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC’s Commercial sites (e.g. those operated by BBC Studios and BBC Global News Ltd) are acceptable only when editorially justified. We should not be seen to promote the BBC’s Commercial sites and we should not link to such sites in preference to other editorially relevant sites.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Public Service References to BBC Commercial sites 14.3.23
For links from an individual Public Service page to a corresponding BBC Commercial page which features BBC branded products see Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests: Trails for Commercial Products related to BBC Programmes.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Trails for Commercial Products related to BBC Programmes 14.3.24
Where appropriate, an interstitial page may appear on the user's journey between the Public Service site and the BBC’s Commercial site. It will let users know that they are leaving the public service site and offer them a choice.
For transactional links from Public Service Platforms to Commercial Products Related to BBC Editorial Content see Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests: Transactional links from Public Service Platforms to Commercial Products Related to BBC Editorial Content 14.3.25
Links to buy tickets
BBC programmes and sites regularly cover music concerts and tours. Linking policy to sites where users can buy tickets will depend on the nature of the event.
If it is a BBC mounted or run event (on the Public Services to contribute to the BBC’s Mission and Public Purposes), then a direct link to the source of the tickets is likely to be editorially justifiable.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing Ticket Sales 16.3.34)
If it is not a BBC mounted or run event (and where for example a BBC network is simply broadcasting a concert organised by someone else) then a direct link to the relevant band’s site is likely to be editorially justifiable, with one more click from there to the ticket agency’s site.
Part 2: Inbound feeds and embeds
Pulling third-party content on to BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally. Following an external link takes you away from the BBC site and users have a chance to adjust their expectations in the light of that journey. But as third party content sits with BBC content on BBC branded pages, users are more likely to expect it to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards before being published on our site.
Editorial responsibility
The person who is editorially responsible for the page on which the feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed. This principle will apply whether it is a bespoke feed to a single page or a general feed to many pages.
We would not normally embed a live feed of video or text unless we had a contractual relationship with the supplier that provides assurances about the content or we could be otherwise confident that the content is appropriate to be shared on our own platforms.
Transparency
Where we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about it with our users. Attribution should be as close as possible to the content in question.
We should provide a clear and easy route for our users to report a mistake or find offensive or inappropriate content on a feed.
Embeds
Embedded video, for example of a social networking site video player such as YouTube or Vimeo on a BBC page, may be a useful way to display editorially relevant non-BBC content.
Even though the content is not under our control it appears to the audience that it is part of our online content. We should therefore make it clear that the embedded video is from a third party site and give the audience a direct route to report to the relevant editorial team any inappropriate content, such as advertising, that might appear on that video.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidance/feeds-and-links,,bbc,politics,
Disgruntled former ZAPU members launch new party,"The new party is led by Matthew Sibanda, one of five former senior ZAPU officials from Matabeleland South who were expelled in 2022 for opposing the candidacy of Sibangilizwe Nkomo, son of the late ZAPU founding leader Joshua Nkomo, in the party’s presidential race.
The group, commonly referred to as the “Mat South Five” comprising Sibanda, Gideon Dlamini, Echem Nkala, Ernest Ndlovu and Mildred Mkandla accused Nkomo of leveraging his father’s legacy to secure votes at the 2021 congress despite lacking the necessary credentials.
The five had served ZAPU in various provincial and national capacities since 2011.
However, they were expelled in November 2022 after raising concerns about irregularities in Nkomo’s election, alleging that Nkomo garnered 121 votes, even though only 105 delegates were registered to vote.
After their concerns were dismissed internally, the group sought legal recourse in June 2023 but the Bulawayo High Court upheld Nkomo’s nomination and confirmed his presidency of ZAPU.
Despite the legal setback, Sibanda, now interim president of O ZAPU, insisted that their goal was not to create a new political party but to restore the original ZAPU, which he claimed had strayed from its founding principles under Nkomo’s leadership.
“In fact, we are not forming a new party. We are reviving the original ZAPU because the party’s constitution was violated when Sibangilizwe took over the presidency,” Sibanda said during the launch held last Saturday in Bulawayo.
Sibanda argued that ZAPU had lost direction and relevance under Nkomo’s tenure.
“During the previous elections, the party failed to field candidates for both council and parliamentary seats in Bulawayo. Even the president himself did not contest,” he noted.
Sibanda pledged that O ZAPU would institute reforms and prioritise national development if elected into power.
“We will focus on infrastructure development and revamping the country’s ailing healthcare system,” he stated.
Sibanda also insisted Nkomo’s leadership as ZAPU president was illegitimate, claiming he was not a registered party member at the time of his election and had never held any official position within the party structures.
“I was ZAPU’s chairperson for Matabeleland South, and I can confirm that Sibangilizwe was not in any structures in the province. The ZAPU constitution is very clear, one must rise through the ranks, from branch level to national, to be eligible for leadership,” he said.
He went further to accuse Nkomo of forging his party credentials to qualify for the 2021 presidential contest.
“Sibangilizwe was simply imposed because he is the son of the party’s late commander,” Sibanda claimed.
The launch of O ZAPU was attended by Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP) vice president Sibongile Banda and the party’s Secretary for Legal Affairs, Nkosilathi Khanye.
Some ZAPU delegates from all ten provinces also attended the event while Stylish Magida was introduced as the interim Secretary General of the new formation.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/disgruntled-former-zapu-members-launch-new-party/,2025-06-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Security agent blocks opposition MP’s engagement meeting,"TellZim News Reporter
A Central Intelligence Officer (CIO) in Chiredzi is alleged to have obstructed Chiredzi Central Constituency Member of Parliament, Ropafadzo Makumire from carrying out his engagement soccer tournament at Chishamiso Stadium recently despite the meeting having been explicitly approved by both the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ) TellZim News reports.
The MP recently held an interface meeting at Chishamiso Stadium in Hippo Valley to engage the electorate and the event included various sporting activities, such as soccer and netball.
However, the activities were disrupted when the officer, Tinashe Muyambo, parked his black Toyota GD6 at the centre of the stadium drinking beer with his friends for about three hours.
Makumire confirmed the incident to TellZim News and condemned Muyambo’s disruptive behaviour and went on to thank the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and the Central Intelligence Office for their quick intervention in handling the situation.
“The situation instilled fear within the community due to this individual’s presence. Many residents were understandably upset and felt the need to take action, but we intervened to maintain peace.
“It is important to acknowledge the police and officials from the president’s office who swiftly removed him from the ground. We hold the office of the President to a higher standard and do not accept such behaviour. This situation must be addressed to restore confidence in our community. The programme was intended to engage with the community to discuss pressing issues and provide feedback to the people,” said Makumire.
The meeting had been sanctioned by the Zimbabwe Republic Police to begin at 0900 hours and end at 1730 hours, but the meeting started later at 1200 hours due to Muyambo’s actions.
Hippo Valley Community Services Officer, Brawl Chikandiwa had written to Makumire giving him permission to hold the interface meeting at Chishamiso Stadium with some set guidelines including informing the police and maintaining cleanliness.
“I write to inform you that your request has been granted. You are free to use the requested; however, you are advised to make arrangements to inform and avail ZRP for peace and security and ensure the highest level of cleanliness during and after use,” wrote Chikandiwa.
Muyambo had been Makumire’s critic way before he was transferred from Chikombedzi to Chiredzi Office and his behaviour retards development.
There has been delays in the construction of Melbourne Government Primary School, where Makumire channelled part of his Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to pay for labour which is allegedly being attributed to political interference.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/security-agent-blocks-opposition-mps-engagement-meeting/,2025-08-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

ED Term Extension: Zimbabweans Must Unite in Defence of the Constitution,"The Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (The Coalition) urges progressive Zimbabweans to remain vigilant in light of the concerted efforts by the ZANU-PF regime and some self-serving politicians to illegally extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms without a referendum.
We are fully aware of a document drafted by the ZANU PF legal Committee, which convened last month with the specific aim of formulating proposals to implement the ambitious 2030 agenda while intentionally circumventing the constitutional requirement for a national referendum.
The three proposals outlined within this document are not only undemocratic but represent a direct affront to the principles of fair governance. Consequently, it is imperative that as citizens we mount a robust resistance against these moves through a multifaceted approach that includes legal challenges, strategic engagement within parliament especially with progressive members from both the opposition and ruling party benches, and organized mass action across communities.
Additionally, we note that the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, was also assigned the task of providing a legal opinion on the viability of achieving the 2030 agenda without resorting to a referendum, a process critical to ensuring democratic legitimacy.
Furthermore, we have become aware of a Memorandum presented to Cabinet by Ziyambi Ziyambi, the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, proposing to amend the constitution with the explicit goal of extending the terms of office for the president, parliamentary representatives, and local council officials.
This amendment, to be pushed through by the ZANU PF caucus and in connivance with a section of compromised opposition legislators led by Sengezo Tshabangu, seeks to postpone upcoming elections, shifting the timeline from 2028 to 2030, thereby undermining the democratic process. This self-serving agenda reflects a total disregard for the will of the people of Zimbabwe as reflected in the 2013 constitution that was unanimously voted for by the people of Zimbabwe.
The 2013 constitution was supposed to mark a shift from an authoritarian to a more democratic society and this power grab (under the guise of Vision 2030) is an affront to the Constitution of Zimbabwe and the democratic aspirations of the Zimbabwean people. Any such amendment will have to go through a referendum where the people of Zimbabwe will participate.
It is regrettable that despite the 2013 Constitution being lauded as progressive, Zimbabwe continues to witness consolidation of authoritarianism, repression, and the ideology of a one-pin power indefinitely against the aspirations of Zimbabweans who voted for the 2013 Constitution as well as the aspirations of living and fallen heroes of Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle.
The Coalition is fully aware that self-serving politicians and a cartel of corrupt individuals who continue to benefit from the plunder of national resources are behind the push to extend President Mnangagwa’s stay in office.
Regrettably, we continue to witness amendments to the Constitution that have ushered in draconian legislation like the PVO Act which has further shrunk the democratic space in Zimbabwe.
The Coalition reiterates its call for Zimbabweans, across political, ethnic, and social divides, to unite and reject this unconstitutional power grab.
Through our Constitutional Hubs established in various parts of the country, the Coalition will mobilize grassroots communities to resist the illegal extension of President Mnangagwa’s stay in office which symbolizes consolidation of authoritarianism and erosion of democracy.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/ed-term-extension-zimbabweans-must-unite-in-defence-of-the-constitution/,2025-05-30 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

A. Roles
GDPR distinguishes between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).

Our lawful bases include where: (i) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our Service Providers or Partner Entities; (ii) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, provided that your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our interests.

Additionally, the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by Partner Entities (as described above) in relation to your use of the Services.

where applicable, withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing.

Fear and Greed Index - Investor Sentiment,"What is the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index?
The Fear & Greed Index is a way to gauge stock market movements and whether stocks are fairly priced. The theory is based on the logic that excessive fear tends to drive down share prices, and too much greed tends to have the opposite effect.
How is Fear & Greed Calculated?
The Fear & Greed Index is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behavior. They are market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand. The index tracks how much these individual indicators deviate from their averages compared to how much they normally diverge. The index gives each indicator equal weighting in calculating a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing maximum greediness and 0 signaling maximum fear.
How often is the Fear & Greed Index calculated?
Every component and the Index are calculated as soon as new data becomes available.
How to use Fear & Greed Index?
The Fear & Greed Index is used to gauge the mood of the market. Many investors are emotional and reactionary, and fear and greed sentiment indicators can alert investors to their own emotions and biases that can influence their decisions. When combined with fundamentals and other analytical tools, the Index can be a helpful way to assess market sentiment.

Beekeepers in Rural Zimbabwe Embrace Technology to Unlock Progress,"Fadziso Mudzingwa sighed in frustration. It was June 2024, the middle of winter in Zimbabwe, and the low temperatures were killing her bees.
She was tired, too—she’d spent the day trekking between her home and her hives in the forest, checking them frequently in the hope of saving both the colonies and her barely profitable honey business.
Despite her protective gear, Fadziso had been stung twice, and she was falling behind in her other tasks. The sun was setting, and her children were waiting for dinner.
She didn’t know it yet, but everything was about to change for the better. She was about to take part in a pilot project in her hometown, Marondera, led by the Internet Society Zimbabwe Chapter, learning to monitor hive conditions remotely and in real time using a mobile app connected to smart sensors.
This technology would truly make a difference—one year later, Fadziso’s work is much easier and her hives are thriving, as is her business. While she sold just 50 liters of honey in 2024, before the project began, she has already produced 130 liters in the first half of 2025.
An Industry in Need of Solutions
Beekeeping can be profitable in Zimbabwe, especially as people commonly use honey and other apiary products—beeswax, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly—for medicinal purposes. The industry is also a positive force for the environment, acting as a catalyst for forest renewal and biodiversity conservation through plant pollination.
Yet things weren’t always positive for Marondera beekeepers, most of whom faced challenges similar to Fadziso’s. Chamunorwa Rupiya also struggled to juggle multiple responsibilities. “As the owner of a tuck shop, I needed to pay someone to fill in for me while I was away inspecting my hives,” he said.
Many struggled to find time to sell products. “I spent most of my days tending to my bees,” said John Chivamba. “I worried about them constantly. Then, when I had the chance, I would go and sell honey on the road leading to Harare.”
And when poor conditions or predators harmed their colonies, the resulting drop in yields meant greater financial hardship for beekeepers.
Monitoring Beehives Remotely
In late 2024, the Zimbabwe Chapter launched a project designed to solve these challenges and safeguard the beekeepers’ livelihoods as well as the community’s food security. Partnering with Shift Organic Technologies and the Harare Institute of Technology, they developed an Internet of Things (IoT) solution comprising hive sensors and a user-friendly mobile app.
Beekeepers can use this app to check factors such as temperature, humidity, and bee activity at a glance, from anywhere, without having to open up their hives or disturb the bees. The data collected can also predict potential health issues and environmental changes, enabling farmers to take proactive measures.
This project, called IoT for Apiary Analytics, included training for the beekeepers. The 20 initial participants not only learned to use the technology but also received instruction in advanced techniques, such as protecting hives from winter temperatures.
“The trainers taught us which flowers to plant around our hives so our bees can always get their favorite pollen,” said Fadziso. “We also learned to set up water points to maintain the hives’ natural humidity.”
Technology Changes the Game
Being able to monitor their hives remotely has revolutionized beekeeping for Fadziso, Chamunorwa, and John. “Now, instead of hiking into the forest first thing every morning, I simply look at my phone for hive updates,” said Fadziso. “I can check on them in minutes, not hours, so I have more time for my children, household chores, and developing new products like floor wax.”
This IoT solution has been a game changer! I can now keep an eye on my bees while selling honey on the road. I make more money and enjoy peace of mind.”
John Chivamba
Meanwhile, Chamunorwa saves money by relying on hired help less often, since he can manage his hives from his shop.
The project has yielded undeniable improvements in bee health and hive productivity. “My production has risen 30 percent and the wax quality is better too,” said Fadziso. Chamunorwa has seen similar improvements, noting that his colonies have grown since the installation of the devices.
Charting the Path Forward
Looking to the future, the beekeepers plan to invest their extra earnings in more sensors to expand their businesses. “My new aim is to sell in major cities, like Harare and Bulawayo, and even to export my honey!” Fadziso said with a smile.
They hope to see further tech innovations in areas such as pest management and honey harvesting. Learning to build the IoT sensors locally to bring down their cost is another goal.
All agree that embracing technology has been life-changing.
Being part of this project means a lot to me. It’s empowered me to take control of my work and improve my family’s quality of life.”

"ECA capacitates Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi in e-commerce tools and marketing strategies","She was speaking at the workshop on E-Commerce Marketing and Business Development Strategies for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Global Markets convened by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), through its African Institute for Economic Development and Planning (IDEP) and its Sub-Regional Office for Southern Africa (SROSA) and funded by the Government of Italy.
The overall objective of the workshop was to strengthen the skills of participants from Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe to leverage e-trade opportunities in the context of AfCFTA. Mr. Enrico de Agostini, Ambassador of Italy in Zambia reiterated the importance of capacity building of entrepreneurs in the region to ensure sustainable development.
Ms. Beatrice Mutali, United Nations Resident Coordinator, speaking on behalf of the UN family in Zambia underscored the importance of partnerships between governments, international partners, private sector and the UN to address the gaps in digital trade such as infrastructure, connectivity to payment systems and regulatory frameworks.
The Director of ECA Subregional office for Southern Africa, Ms. Eunice Kamwendo, in her opening remarks, emphasised the efforts of ECA in implementing innovative and practical initiatives in order to better support member states. An example of which is this e-commerce training that was intended to provide strategic and practical tools necessary to unlock opportunities in the e-commerce space under the AfCFTA and in global markets.
She further noted that, the AfCFTA, with its promise of a US$3.4 trillion single market, presents ECA and its partners with a unique platform to reimagine value chains, promote innovation, and stimulate sustainable growth driven by the private sector. “At ECA, we believe that digitalization when guided by inclusive policies and backed by the right skills can bridge development gaps, unlock new markets, and catalyze youth employment”.
To complement the training ECA-SROSA experts presented on the AfCFTA and initiatives related to the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement. Ms. Zodwa Mabuza, Chief Sub-Regional Initiatives outlined the protocol on digital trade indicating that it helps harmonize rules to boost Africa’s digital economy, cutting cross-border e-commerce costs, building trust, and supporting Small and Medium Enterprises. Ms. Bineswaree Bolaky, Economic Affairs Officer presented on the AfCFTA, its rationale and instruments, and on ECA’s work on AfCFTA, e-commerce and digital trade including outlining ECA’s support to member States on developing their National AfCFTA Strategies and Green Supplements to these strategies. Mr. Henry Lubinda, Programme Officer gave an overview of SRO-SA’s major areas of support to member States such as inclusive industrialization, green transitions, enhanced food systems and AfCFTA-led trade in Southern Africa.
The training consisting of 6 sessions, was facilitated by Mr. Fabio Santoni ASeS-CeFor, the implementing partner of the project funded by Italy. Participants were trained through scenarios and business simulation techniques.
At the closing of the workshop, certificates were remitted to participants by Mr. Aime Mbatkam, coordinator of the project at ECA’s training arm, the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning.
This collaborative initiative between ECA and the Government of Italy aimed at supporting Member states through a capacity building programme for the effective implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement. Under Phase 2, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Malawi, Mauritania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe benefitted from (i) an assessment of e-trade readiness and (ii) a capacity needs assessment of stakeholders for AfCFTA implementation.

Zimbabwe residents lose funds to illegal Bitcoin trading company,"Residents in Zimbabwe have lost funds to a fraudulent trading platform that advertises crypto investment opportunities on Facebook. According to reports, the investment platform masquerades as InnBucks Investment, luring innocent people into depositing their funds using Ecocash, which is moved to the fake trading platform.
According to local reports, the platform promises residents in Zimbabwe the opportunity to make profits from Bitcoin trading, agreeing to trade the asset on their behalf. They are asked to register accounts on the Amexcyp Market platform using their specialized link.
“Here is an opportunity to make x3 of your investment without any hidden fees or withdrawal fees 100% safe and secure. And also have access to your trading account. Send us a message now to start,” one of their advertisement posts reads.
Zimbabwe residents lose funds to bogus investment platform
According to reports, the platform has other types of advertisements spread across Facebook, targeting unsuspecting residents of the country. “Other platforms may falter, but we remain the best place for safe and secure coins trading in Zimbabwe. Trade on InnBucks investment today!” another post read.
However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. “Stay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels—call us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,” InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform’s posts.
According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24, the fake trading platform’s posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account.
Upon enquiry, “Chiunda” mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister’s name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked.
Fake investment officer reveals operations
Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,” she said.
She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register.
For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50.
She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/zimbabwe-residents-lose-funds-to-illegal-bitcoin-trading-company/,2025-09-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Greening China’s ‘brown steel’ investments in Zimbabwe,"Used in infrastructure, vehicles, electricals and much else, steel is a common material in developed countries but is scant in Africa. In 2023, globally, 219 kg of steel was used per person in new products. In sub-Saharan Africa, the per capita consumption was around 30 kg, which is just 14 per cent of the global average.
To change this narrative, two Chinese multinationals, Tsingshan Holding Group and Xinganglian Metallurgical are investing over £3.8 billion in Zimbabwe’s steel industry. Zimbabwe will become Africa’s biggest producer of steel surpassing the current leaders South Africa, Egypt and Morocco. This investment comes at a critical time for Africa as it seeks to reduce its infrastructure deficit. However, most of this steel investment will produce fossil-fuel based ‘brown’ which could potentially hold Zimbabwe and Africa back from fulfilling its ‘green’ steel production potential.
Brown steel vs Green steel
Steel production requires significant energy. It involves heating iron ore or scrap metal to extremely high temperatures (often above 1,000°C) to melt and transform it into steel. Brown steel refers to steel produced using conventional, fossil fuel-based energy such as coal. Green steel is produced with a focus on sustainability, using renewable energy sources and minimizing carbon emissions. Both the Dinson and Palm River Steel projects have coal as their primary source of energy with renewable energy sources providing only a minor contribution.
There are some simple reasons for this. Firstly, coal is cheap to produce. Secondly, steel has traditionally been produced with coal as the main energy source. In traditional production, coal is used as a reducing agent to extract iron from iron ore, as an energy source to provide the high temperatures needed for the steelmaking process, and to help remove impurities and achieve the desired chemical composition. Because of this, the global steel industry is responsible for 9 per cent of global carbon emissions.
The world is increasingly paying attention to how dirty the steel industry is, and concerted efforts are being made to make a shift. Among them are Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) law, which will come into effect in 2026. This European Union (EU) regulation aims to put a price on the carbon emissions of goods imported into the EU. The stated aim is to level the regulatory playing field between EU and foreign producers and reduce carbon leakage, where production is outsourced to places with less stringent environmental protections. This law will affect brown steel investment because CBAM will progressively limit brown steel and products made from brown steel such as car frames for electrical vehicles uncompetitive in the European market. This presents an opportunity for green steel producers, but Zimbabwe may be locking in its brown steel production for years to come.
The Zimbabwean government was the first African country to report its Nationally Determined Contributions Plans that lay outline ambitious targets for emissions reduction, climate resilience, and green economic growth by 2035. Coal emissions in the energy sector were singled out as having to be reduced. The production of brown steel will hamper those efforts. Coal production has turned mining areas and towns into environmental sacrifice zones disproportionately affecting local populations. Dinson Energy for example is mining coal in Hwange to power the steel plant in Manhize exacerbating the 100-year-old colonial consequences of coal mining in the Hwange area. The town is being locked in fossil fuel extraction leading to stranded assets, skills and a dying town because of the lack of transition planning towards a decarbonized global economy.
Green steel
Demand for streel is expected to increase by a third over the next 30 years. This is largely due to growth in Asia and Africa. This makes it more imperative that the industry moves from brown to green steel production.
The technologies required for this to happen are already available. Although not the primary energy source, both new plants in Zimbabwe will have electric arc furnaces which unlike blast furnace, do not need coal to power steel production.
Nearly 30 per cent of global steel is now made through electric arc furnaces gradually chipping away at fossil fuel-based production. Both investments can also use green hydrogen from Namibia to reduce iron ore instead of coal. There will be reduced carbon emissions since there will less to coal being used in the steel plants increasing the steel industry’s alignment with Zimbabwe NDC plans.
Moreover, the Chinese firms investing in Zimbabwe have the latest technology in green hydrogen and electric arc furnaces to make this shift. Bringing in the latest technology on this front will enhance the transfer of skills training from Chinese to local engineers and technicians happening at both steel production sites. This is exemplified through the Shanxi Engineering Vocational college and Harare Polytechnic partnership under the Palm River Energy project.
Beyond producing crude steel, there is massive potential to add value and produce stainless steel. Blessed with energy transition minerals such as nickel and chromium, these is potential for value addition of the minerals leading to a more sustainable and valuable industrial value chain growing in Zimbabwe.
The Palm River Energy project plans to produce one million tonnes a year of stainless steel using the critical energy transition mineral of chromium from Zimbabwe. Dinson’s parent company, Tsingshan is a dominant player in stainless steel production controlling about 25 per cent of the global market primarily through its Indonesia operations. Although Tsingshan has previously raised concerns on the viability of producing stainless steel which also requires nickel which is not found in abundance in Zimbabwe, the potential is still there considering the potential to source nickel from Tanzania, which will also enhance intra-African trade, a key goal of African nations.
Greater cooperation between African countries
The dominant narrative that has come out of these projects is that they are a much-needed boon for Zimbabwe’s manufacturing industry. Although correct, both projects success is reliant on stronger collaboration with the rest of Africa’s economies to meet their potential. The Africa Free Trade Agreement means that the steel produced in Zimbabwe has a ready market in Africa. There is a need for cooperation with South Africa steel companies which are currently in decline to ensure there is no under-cutting of each other’s steel industries which will have a net-negative impact on Africa’s slice of the global steel industry. Cooperating with Namibia will also provide access to green hydrogen which is a key ingredient in producing green steel and potentially nickel from Tanzania.
The move from brown to green steel production is not only an environmental imperative but also an economic necessity to prepare Zimbabwe’s steel investment for a decarbonised world. The Dinson and Palm River Energy projects are much needed initiatives that can propel greater technology transfer, value addition and greater cooperation amongst African countries’ supply and value networks. An increase in the per capita use of steel will be a definite indicator of Africa’s growing industrialisation.

Jude Bellingham’s Rise: How He’s Redefining Real Madrid’s Future,"Jude Bellingham’s Rise: Redefining Real Madrid’s Future
At just 22, Jude Bellingham has already carved out a legacy that most footballers can only dream of. While fans check football scores from today’s games, it’s Bellingham’s performances they’re most eager to see – a testament to how he’s become must-watch football. From his early days at Birmingham City to becoming Real Madrid’s midfield heartbeat since his 2023 transfer, his journey defies expectations. With a rare blend of technical brilliance, leadership beyond his years, and that undeniable swagger, Bellingham isn’t just shaping Los Blancos’ future-he’s redefining the modern midfielder role. Let’s break down the most captivating storylines of his meteoric rise and why the Bernabéu can’t stop chanting his name.
A Star Born in Birmingham
Bellingham’s story starts in the heart of England, where he debuted for Birmingham City at 16, breaking records as the club’s youngest-ever player. By 17, he was captaining the side, showing a maturity that belied his age. His move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020 was a bold step, and he thrived in the Bundesliga, earning praise for his work rate and vision. When Real Madrid paid €103 million for him in 2023, some wondered if the price tag was too steep for a teenager. Two years later, it’s clear: Bellingham was a bargain.
What makes his rise so captivating? It’s his ability to adapt. Whether it’s Dortmund’s high-pressing system or Real Madrid’s possession-based style, Bellingham fits like a glove. His versatility-playing as a box-to-box midfielder, a No. 10, or even a defensive anchor-has made him indispensable. Fans and analysts are buzzing about how he’s redefining the midfield role, blending physicality with finesse.
The Heart of Real Madrid’s New Era
Real Madrid has always been a club of superstars, from Zinedine Zidane to Cristiano Ronaldo. But with legends like Luka Modric and Toni Kroos nearing the end of their careers, the club needed a new face. Enter Bellingham. His impact was immediate: in his first season, he scored 19 goals and provided 6 assists in La Liga, numbers unheard of for a midfielder his age. His knack for clutch moments-like his stoppage-time winner against Barcelona in El Clásico-has cemented his status as a fan favourite.
But it’s not just about stats. Bellingham brings an energy that galvanizes the squad. Despite his youth, his leadership is evident in how he rallies teammates during tense moments. Off the pitch, his charm and fluency in Spanish have won over the Bernabéu faithful. Search trends show fans are obsessed with his personality, with queries like “Jude Bellingham interview” and “Bellingham celebration” spiking on Google. He’s not just a player; he’s a brand, and Real Madrid is building its future around him.
Bellingham’s Reign Begins: Can He Conquer Europe, England & Global Stardom in 2025?
As Bellingham continues to shine, here are the key storylines that make his journey a must-watch:
Can He Lead Real Madrid to Champions League Glory?
Bellingham played a pivotal role in Real Madrid’s 2024 Champions League triumph, but can he take the reins as the club’s leader in future campaigns? With Kylian Mbappé now in the squad, the duo’s chemistry could be unstoppable-or a challenge to balance.
Will He Become England’s Greatest?
Bellingham’s performances for England, especially at the 2026 World Cup, will be crucial. Fans are already searching for “Bellingham England captain,” hinting at his potential to lead the Three Lions to silverware.
How Will He Shape the Midfield?
With Modric and Kroos phasing out, Bellingham is the linchpin alongside younger stars like Eduardo Camavinga and Federico Valverde. His ability to dictate play and mentor others will define Real Madrid’s midfield for years.
Global Stardom Awaits
Bellingham’s marketability is skyrocketing. He’s becoming a global icon, from endorsement deals to social media buzz (his Instagram posts regularly trend). Searches for “Jude Bellingham net worth” and “Bellingham boots” show fans are also invested in his off-field journey.
Why Bellingham Matters
What sets Bellingham apart is his relatability. While pundits dissect yesterday’s matches, it’s his consistency that stands out-the kid who grew up dreaming of the big stage delivers week after week, just like millions of fans hope to. His work ethic, humility, and pure love for the game resonate globally, yet he’s also that rare generational talent who blends physical dominance with a footballing IQ that leaves opponents bewildered. Scrolling through X, you’ll see fans hail him as “the complete package” after every performance. And honestly? They’re not wrong.
As Real Madrid transitions into a new era, Bellingham is the cornerstone. His rise isn’t just about personal accolades; it’s about carrying a club with unmatched history into the future. Whether it’s his jaw-dropping goals, leadership, or infectious passion, Bellingham is rewriting the script for what a midfielder can be. Keep an eye on him-because the football world can’t look away.

Travel and Tourism,"k up conversation with the barman and quickly learned he too was from Zim.
Shonglish flowed soon after as we chatted about the inevitable. My new friend was from the Falls where he had worked at a Lodge, “You know,” he said as he gestured toward the foreign patrons having dinner, “these Europeans, they come all the way from Europe to Cape Town on holiday and all they see is what they have at home; beaches, restaurants, mountains and over-priced shops.” I nodded in agreement with a wry smile. Cape Town was voted best holiday destination by Europe’s leading travel magazine in 2005. “If only I could take them to Zimbabwe and show them the land of milk and honey and what real service is about,” he said.
The conviction he spoke with and the longing he showed to want to showcase his country made me realise that Zimbabwe still has a great deal to offer.
The Falls will always be the 7th Wonder of the World – regardless of who is in power. Tiger fishing on a houseboat trip, canoeing down the Zambesi River or golfing in Nyanga is still all possible. And the downstream benefits from tourism to many suffering Zimbabweans are considerable. By choosing to holiday in Zimbabwe, you could put food on a family’s table, provide medicine for a sick child and give somebody a meaningful day’s work.
Venues4Africa.com has teamed up with The Zimbabwean to showcase ‘the land of milk and honey’.

Human rights - a huge step forward for Africa,"rs.
We now look forward to the continental body distancing itself from its lily-livered past, where it remained culpably silent in the face of mounting evidence of atrocities by various African dictators.
There are several sickening examples of this complicity – notably the massacres in Uganda under Idi Amin, Ethiopia under Mengistu, Somalia under Siad Barre, Charles Taylor in Sierra Leone and Zaire (now DRC) under Mobutu. The list is endless.
However, we find it disturbing that, after passing a resolution condemning Zimbabwe, the commission authorities seemed reluctant to publicise the matter. The report had to be leaked to the press by a conscientious official who was dismayed by hush-up attempts in the higher echelons of power.
The failure by the African Commission on human and peoples’ rights to release a formal statement gave the Zimbabwe government an ideal opportunity to deny, initially, the existence of any such report.
When it became obvious that the report was indeed official, the Mugabe regime attacked it – predictably and childishly accusing the commission of kowtowing to western paymasters.
We utterly reject the double-speak by the AU – and the South African government for that matter – who try to justify quiet diplomacy by arguing that they want to avoid antagonising Mugabe, in the hope that he will be more amenable to persuasion. Some hope. If they cannot read the writing on the wall by now, after five years of madness, their powers of judgment and discernment are questionable to say the least.
The fundamental flaw in their premise is that Mugabe is a reasonable man who can, sooner or later, be made to see the error of his ways and thus change. What a fallacy! Mugabe is well aware that he is transgressing all the AU’s, and indeed the world’s most fundamental human rights principles. He is resorting to this because it is the only way to stay in power. The majority of Zimbabweans have made it abundantly clear that they no long want him or Zanu (PF) to govern them.
African leaders must simply condemn and isolate him. He should be left under no illusion that there is any vestige of support for him on the continent. The credibility of the African Union and its organs, including of course South Africa as the continental powerhouse, are at stake. Africa’s leaders ignore this watershed at their peril.

Sport 25,"tional Cricket Council three years ago after a bitter row with white players but have remained in their posts.
Senior white players led by former captain Heath Streak packed their bags, leaving young Tatenda Taibu to lead a group of inexperienced players to massive defeats. Taibu was to follow two years later, also citing leadership problems.
The Zimbabwean has spoken to sources within provincial structures who revealed a plan to “make cricket ungovernable for Chingoka”.
“We were shocked once again. But it is the same story of rigging and manipulation of the structures that enabled Chingoka to bounce back,” said a veteran cricket administrator, on condition of anonymity.
A leader of one of the provinces added, “It has become an embarrassment that we seem to imply a serious lack of capable people in this country. The irony of it is we have just suffered another embarrassment in losing to Bangladesh, and the young players, who they thought would be used to cover up for their madness, are also frustrated.
“We are mobilising for serious measures that must make Chingoka realise he is no longer wanted. Cricket belongs to the grassroots and so we shall make it ungovernable, for Chingoka to go.”
Efforts to obtain comment from Chingoka and Ozias Bvute were unsuccessful.
Foreign levy on athletes mooted
HARARE Hard-pressed Zimbabwean athletes making a beeline to South Africa to compete in lucrative events across the border will have to think again, as the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe are proposing to introduce a clearance levy of $500 000 per race.
NAAZ already collects 10% of the athletes’ foreign prize money.
The latest proposal is seen as a move to stem the tide of athletes leaving the country for greener pastures.
Samukeliso Moyo, a regular runner on the South African circuit and a representative of the Athletes Commission, described the levy as ‘robbing a living from the suffering athletes’.
The levy was supposed to be adopted at the NAAZ Annual General Meeting held in Gweru last December, but was turned down by the Athletes Commission, who threatened to withdraw from national duty.
The athletes said they would not be taking part in the All Africa Games in July if an exorbitant levy was introduced.
Moyo said, “We have no other jobs besides running. We earn our living from running and NAAZ want to take that away from us. How many athletes can afford to fork out $350 000 each time they are going out of the country to compete in the races? We are against this levy.
“Besides, it is the norm that they (NAAZ) collect 10% of our prize money. It’s unfair and we need to consult,” Moyo fumed.
“We hardly have a race in Zimbabwe that has prize money of $500 000, and proposing a levy of $350 000 for one to compete outside the country is very unfair. Most of the athletes are going to South Africa because there are no paying races in Zimbabwe. We are going outside the country to earn a living. Running is all that we know,” Moyo said.
David Leboho, the NAAZ treasurer, said they were going ahead with the levy but would hold further negotiations with the Athletes Commission on the ‘figures’.
Leboho said, “There is an influx of Zimbabwe athletes in South Africa. They are a thorn in the flesh for the South Africans because they are dominating most of the races like the Comrades Marathon, City to City and Two Oceans. The South Africans are not happy but there is nothing they can do. Currently there is no law in place prohibiting foreigners competing in their races”.
Some of the athletes who have made South Africa their second home are Kudakwashe Kanduna, Thabita Tsatsa, Rutendo Nyahoza, Moyo, Marko Mambo, Oliver Kandiero, Cuthbert Nyasango, Tsungai Mwenengeni, Elijah Mutandiro and Elmore Sibanda. – CAJ News.
Dube bout marks new era
BULAWAYO – National heavyweight boxing champion Tamsanqa Dube is set to benefit from sporting relations recently established between Zimbabwe and South Africa when he takes part in an eight-rounder against a boxer from the Leonard Neil stable, it emerged yesterday.
The bout, Dube’s first assignment across the Limpopo, was brokered by South African promoter Paul Tshehla following consultations with the Zimbabwe National Boxing Control Board and the boxer’s new management company, Fly High Boxing Promotions.
Tshehla revealed from Johannesburg this week that the Dube encounter will be one of several supporting bouts put together for the World Boxing Association welterweight title fight between Ishmael Kuchocha (Zimbabwe) and defending champion Welcome Ntshingila of South Africa.
Although the venue of the event was yet to be confirmed, Tshehla said, “This, I’m hopeful, will mark the beginning of a renewed long and convenient relationship between Harare and ourselves, as we last had such boxing relations way back in the early ’80s. February 7 will certainly herald the beginning of big things to come in as far as the sport is concerned”.
The SA promoter said he would also take another Zimbabwean champion, Wellington Phiri, to Namibia in early March for an international friendly match versus Jason Naule at Oranjemund. The package will comprise a total of eight fights (seven of them featuring South Africans) with the main draw-card being the WBA title fight between Tshehla’s son, Anthony, and Paulus ‘The Hitman’ Moses. – CAJ News.

Henry’s late strike stuns
By JOHN HUGHES
ENGLAND – Thierry Henry’s stoppage-time header snatched a 2-1 home win for Arsenal over table-topping Manchester United – and kept alive Chelsea’s dream of a third successive English Premiership title.
But stuttering Chelsea, six points behind in second place amid reports of internal unrest, slipped up again by losing 2-0 at Liverpool to early goals by Dirk Kuyt and Jermaine Pennant. For goalkeeper Petr Cech, wearing a protective headguard three months after fracturing his skull, it was an unhappy return.
Fifth-placed Bolton, harbouring hopes of European football next season, crashed 5-1 at Middlesbrough, local boy Stewart Downing setting up the first three goals before cracking in the fourth himself. El Hadji Diouf, Bolton’s Senegal frontman, was sent off for aiming a verbal volley at the referee.
Reading’s romantic run in their first Premiership season continued with a 3-1 home win over Sheffield United. But the match was marred by United’s Keith Gillespie being red-carded just 20 seconds after stepping off the bench and a mass touchline brawl that saw his manager Neil Warnock banished from the dugout.
□ Dutch striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink hit a hat-trick in Celtic’s 5-1 home demolition of St Mirren in the Scottish Premier. Celtic led the table by 17 points from Rangers who won 1-0 at Dunfermline.

Why are Zimbabwe Police Chasing Off Some of the Economy’s Biggest Players?,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE — The vendors rarely see it coming. The municipal police, some in plainclothes and others in uniform, move through the crowd silent and unnoticed. When they finally strike, panic erupts. Vendors scatter, trampling their goods and grabbing what they can. A few are arrested. Their wares are seized and tossed into the back of a police truck.
“They have no mercy at all. Once they take your stock, you’ll never get it back,” says Saul Nhema, an informal vendor who has been selling vegetables for three months after losing his job as a construction worker.
On the day of this interview, the municipal police had already raided these informal vendors selling along Park Street in Harare’s central business district twice. As Global Press Journal reporters interviewed Nhema, they struck again. He grabbed his stock and fled in the middle of the interview.
The Harare City Council has for years waged such crackdowns on vendors, often destroying goods and deploying heavy police forces. Local government insists these crackdowns are necessary to enforce city bylaws, citing vending from illegal spots, littering and health concerns.
Yet the scale and intensity of recent operations, backed by expanding police presence and significant public spending, have raised questions. Critics argue that the government is wasting scarce resources targeting informal vendors all while it struggles to provide city residents with basic services, such as clean water.
In 2024, the council’s revenue stood at just US$3 million. But policing costs for these crackdowns exceeded US$24 million, eight times the council’s income.
In 2025, the council escalated its crackdown by creating a specialized police unit to target vendors, further deepening the financial strain with a slight budget increase — and pushing the total to around 12 times its income, which is projected to fall to just US$2 million.
As the council’s income dwindles, the central government shoulders much of the financial burden.
Global Press Journal made numerous requests for an interview with the mayor. He did not respond.
The additional cost of the special police unit is hard to justify, given the potential benefits of supporting informal vendors, says Reuben Akili, director of the Combined Harare Residents Association.
“If we examine the funds allocated for enforcement covering salaries, fuel and operational costs, those resources could have been redirected toward rehabilitating markets or public restrooms in the city,” Akili says.
The informal sector already sustains over 80% of Zimbabwe’s population and contributes nearly 72% to the country’s gross domestic product. Street vendors dominate the sector in many African countries, accounting for over 85% of jobs, many held by women.
In Zimbabwe, the vendors are becoming increasingly critical, as the country’s currency crisis forces many retail shops to shut down.
Despite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.
A special municipal police unit to push out this critical population in Harare will only inflate the city’s workforce, which ultimately burdens taxpayers, Akili says. Instead, he says the council should build infrastructure where vendors can comfortably work.
“Did that result in any significant change in terms of the challenges that we are seeing? I think it’s a big no,” Wadzai says.
At times, vendors resort to bribing officers to avoid the disruption of evictions. Jesman Guvheya has worked as an informal vendor for two years. The widowed mother of five says the police sometimes demand US$1 a day from each vendor.
“But there can be three or four groups that move at different times per day and you may end up paying 4 US dollars to avoid being raided,” she says.
And that bribe is never a guarantee one will trade without interruption. The police could swoop in and confiscate everything, even after a vendor has paid the bribe. “Sometimes we are left with little stock that we will have secured elsewhere,” she says, preparing to flee from police she has just spotted.
Although Guvheya escaped arrest that day, her son, also a street vendor, wasn’t as fortunate. The council police apprehended him, and she had to follow the truck to pay a bribe so he could be freed.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/why-are-zimbabwe-police-chasing-off-some-of-the-economys-biggest-players/,2025-09-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Zimbabwe to ban export of lithium concentrates from 2027,"HARARE – Zimbabwe will ban the export of lithium concentrates from 2027 as it extends its push for more local processing, mines minister Winston Chitando said on Tuesday.
Africa’s top producer of lithium, used in batteries to power renewable energy technologies, banned the export of lithium ore in 2022 and has been pushing miners to process more domestically.
Lithium miners in Zimbabwe, who are mostly from China, have been exporting concentrates to their home country.
Chitando said lithium sulphate plants were currently being developed at two Zimbabwean mines, Bikita Minerals, owned by Sinomine, opens and Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe, owned by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt.
Lithium sulphate is an intermediate product which can be refined into a battery-grade material such as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate used in battery manufacturing.
“Because of that capacity which is now in the country, the export of all lithium concentrates will be banned from January 2027,” Chitando said during a media briefing following a weekly cabinet meeting.
In 2023, Zimbabwe gave lithium miners up to March 2024 to submit plans for developing local refineries, but softened its stance after prices of the metal collapsed.
Sinomine and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt are part of a group of Chinese firms, including Chengxin Lithium Group, Yahua Group and Canmax Technologies, which have spent more than $1 billion since 2021 to acquire and develop lithium projects in Zimbabwe. – Reuters

"Father first, miner Second: Why a Gwanda artisanal miner puts family before all.","With the fear of losing his job and the little income he was getting at the end of each month weighing heavily on him, Zibusiso decided to leave his general hand job at one of the foreign-owned commercial gold mines in Gwanda. He became one among thousands of people who had joined the gold mining rush at small scale artisanal mining sites across the country as the deteriorating economic situation continued to affect the population.
But life has not been as kind as he hoped it would be. After 20 years, Zibusiso is still here. The promises of gold have faded, but his determination remains.
“There is not so much change”, Zibusiso recounts. “Life is not as good as people think it is for miners. We go for two months without an income. To survive, we must borrow from our ‘sponsors’* who will then recover their money once we realise any profits”, adds Zibusiso.
Regardless, Zibusiso continues to toil daily to meet the basic needs of his family of six children, four of them still in school, and a wife he met in 2003 in Tshebetshebe, just two years after he arrived in 2001.
“On a good day, we make between 500 to 1,500 Rands. But good days are rare,” he says.
Daily, Zibusiso works long hours underground in mine shafts that are anything between 30 and 300 metres deep. He is painfully aware of the dangers – unstable shafts, toxic dust and harmful chemicals, and the ever-present risk of injury, yet, driven by the need to provide for his family, he soldiers on, armed with little more than a shovel, plastic containers, a hammer and a wheelbarrow among other basic mining equipment-no safety gear, no personal protective equipment. This exposes him and many other small-scale artisanal miners to serious health conditions such as respiratory issues, silicosis, tuberculosis and physical injuries.
“It’s dangerous, I know, but these are the sacrifices we make for our loved ones,” says Zibusiso. “My family comes first. I make sure that I support them from the proceeds I get from mining. This means that things such as protective clothing and proper mining equipment are not a huge priority for me.”
Zibusiso’s family lives about five kilometres from the mine. They visit every two to three weeks to check up on him and collect money for the family’s basic needs. Sadly, Zibusiso’s eldest daughter was home when we met him as he was yet to pay school fees for her and three other siblings two weeks after schools had opened.
*Sponsors for gold mining are individuals who typically provide funding, equipment, food and other necessities to a group of artisanal miners. In exchange, the small-scale artisanal miners (also known as othseketstha in Ndebele), pay some proceeds from the sale of gold and give a certain percentage to these sponsors for their support.
“As you can see, she is still home because I haven’t been able to raise school fees yet, but I hope that I will get something so I can pay the school.”
While the economic situation has not changed much for Zibusiso, he has found a ray of hope on the healthcare side. In the past, he and his colleagues could not even afford to take time off work to seek treatment, often enduring severe symptoms silently.
But now things have improved due to a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) comprehensive health outreach programme, as artisanal miners and the host community can now access healthcare services.
The outreach programme aims to bridge the health services gap and bring essential healthcare services directly to the miners’ doorsteps. Through the Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining Basic Healthcare project (ASGM-BHC), MSF works hand in hand with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to deliver free, accessible care to over 30 mining sites in the Gwanda district. The project offers screenings, treatment for common illnesses, mental health support, and health education, all while working closely with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to improve service delivery for hard-to-reach communities.
“We used to walk long distances of up to 5km to the nearest clinic. Sometimes we would commute to Gwanda which is about 20km away to receive treatment. Besides paying for treatment, getting the service itself was hard because sometimes medication was not available regardless of time spent in queues and travel time. We would only seek treatment when one’s health condition deteriorated because we did not always have the money and time to do so. Our work demands that we work every day, this is how one gets more money, and in the spirit of teamwork, you cannot be away from work,” Zibusiso says.
“For the first time in 24 years of my experience as an artisanal miner, I had never experienced this. We are getting treatment for almost everything here, where we work. We are now receiving treatment for most of the conditions here at the mine. TB, HIV and STIs are very common conditions affecting miners,” Zibusiso says.
Artisanal miners like Zibusiso are often criminalised or forgotten, operating in informal spaces where survival is the only constant but he is grateful to MSF for giving him and his fellow miners a health life line to enable them to at least work for the betterment of their families with less worry on their health needs and that of their families.

South Africa pick five uncapped players for Zimbabwe Tests,"The two-match Test series will take place at Queen Sports Club, Bulawayo, from 28 June to 10 July. The series will be South Africa’s first outing after the World Test Championship Final 2025.
Bavuma will continue as captain, which sees several Test team regulars like Kagiso Rabada, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs rested.
In their place, Lhuan-dré Pretorius, Lesego Senokwane, Codi Yusuf, Dewald Brevis and Prenelan Subrayen find a place. All the players are yet to make their Test debut, while this is a maiden call-up for Pretorius, Senokwane and Yusuf.
Lhuan-dré Pretorius is the rising teen sensation of South African cricket. He had a breakout season in the CSA 4-Day Series, scoring three centuries and finishing with an impressive average of 72.66.
Joining him as another exciting prospect is Lesego Senokwane, who also amassed 559 runs in the first-class competition, including three hundreds. Both players recently made their South Africa ‘A ‘ debuts in the series against West Indies A, signaling their rapid rise through the ranks.
Codi Yusuf is an exciting pace prospect, who picked 23 wickets in the 4-Day Series, at an average of 22.39.
Subrayen and Brevis are uncapped at the Test level but have travelled with the side before. Subrayen was on full fire against West Indies ‘A’ in a recent first-class fixture, picking up a five-wicket haul and scoring 64 runs in an innings win for South Africa ‘A’. Brevis has impressed ever since having made his mark at the U19 level, and was the second-highest run-getter in the domestic first-class level this past season.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/south-africa-pick-five-uncapped-players-for-zimbabwe-tests/,2025-07-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Zimbabwe Losing US$4 Billion To Looting Annually - Biti,"In his remarks reflecting on the current state of the economy, Biti said the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April 2024 marked the beginning of what he called “economic carnage,” with massive consequences for production, employment, and livelihoods. Biti said:
There is carnage in the economy. The introduction of the ZIG in April 2024 marked a significant slide towards collapse, deceleration and shrinkage. The ZiG-induced depression has seen companies close or exit and a massive devaluation of social services.
The former minister, who oversaw economic stabilisation during the Government of National Unity (GNU) era from 2009 to 2013, said the retail sector is buckling under the combined pressures of exchange rate volatility, high taxation, overregulation, and a rapidly expanding informal economy that now dominates urban commerce.
Biti pointed to the worsening power supply crisis as a key driver of economic deterioration, accusing the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) of failing to meet energy demands necessary to sustain industrial activity and protect jobs.
Beyond structural inefficiencies, Biti highlighted rampant corruption at the heart of government operations as a major drag on economic recovery. He said:
Public procurement, fuel, commodities, and Treasury disbursements have become major centres of looting. Easily, US$4 is being lost annually through blatant looting by political cartels and bandits.
Biti was particularly critical of the monetary authorities’ handling of the exchange rate and currency reforms, describing the ZiG dollar as a “myth” designed to enable state-backed extraction through manipulation and fraud.
Despite authorities’ efforts to promote the local unit, Biti noted that 80% of all transactions in Zimbabwe are still conducted in US dollars, revealing the collapse of confidence in the new currency. He said:
De-dollarisation is a failed ritual, with 80 % of all transactions done in US$. The ZIG$ is a myth, a lie, imposed to guarantee extraction through exchange manipulation and fraud.
He warned that mismanagement of exchange controls has fueled hyperinflation and wiped out the real value of public sector wages, pushing civil servants into poverty.
The human cost of the economic implosion is already visible. Biti pointed out that university lecturers have been on strike since April, citing eroded wages, and over 5,000 teachers have exited public service, unable to survive on current salaries.

Zimbabwe sets new 300m kg tobacco output,"Zimbabwe has set a new tobacco production record after more than 300 million kilo of leaf tobacco worth over $1 billon have been sold since the marketing season opened in March, the country’s industry regulatory body announced on Wednesday.
The Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) confirmed that Zimbabwe has officially surpassed its all-time national tobacco production record of 296 million kilogrammes achieved in 2023, after this year’s seasonal cumulative sales reached over 300 million kg on Wednesday.
“This year’s marketing season has been historic. As of June 18, Zimbabwe has sold over 300 million kg of tobacco, a new and all-time record,” Chelesani Tsarwe, a TIMB public affairs officer, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that the one-billion-dollar revenue for farmers is another milestone worth celebrating.
She noted that while the production milestone reflects resilience and hard work across the value chain, the ideal future is not just about record volumes, but also about increased local processing, enhanced farmer earnings, diversified markets, and environmentally sustainable practices in the tobacco sector.
“We must shift from volume-driven horizontal growth to value-driven growth,” she said.
In 2021, Zimbabwe launched a tobacco value chain transformation plan, aiming to increase leaf tobacco production to 300 million kilos annually and transform the industry into a $5 billion industry by 2025.
As a pillar of Zimbabwe’s economy, tobacco is primarily exported to China and South Africa, among other countries, significantly contributing to export earnings and rural livelihoods.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/zimbabwe-sets-new-300m-kg-tobacco-output/,2025-06-20 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,
Proteas batters dominate opening day in Zimbabwe warm-up,"Ahead of the all-important Ultimate Test against Australia at Lord’s in a week, the South Africa players hit the ground running in a warm-up fixture against Zimbabwe in Arundel.
Even as the two African sides feature in the practice game, the South African minds were focussed on the Australian challenge ahead.
Speaking on the tussle to follow this contest, opening batter Aiden Markram outlined the Proteas’ mindset for the World Test Championship Final.
“I think it’s the collective decision for each guy to bring their best skill. It’s going to be a tough game,” Markram told ICC Digital.
“It’s a Test match, of course, against Australia and a Dukes ball, Lord’s, all those sorts of things, but ultimately, the guys have a skillset that have got them here, got them selected, throughout the cycle performed as well, doing those skills.
“So it’s about backing that, our best skill versus their (Australia’s) best skill, and we’ll see where it lands us at the end of the day.”
The first day of the encounter was washed out, but the Proteas got much-needed game practice on Day 2.
The South Africa batters got a good workout after the side opted to bat in the warm-up clash.
Despite losing Aiden Markram for 13 early in the day, the Proteas batting unit picked it up as half-centuries from Ryan Rickelton, skipper Temba Bavuma, and in-form Tristan Stubbs led them to a formidable total of 313/2, following which they declared their innings.
Rickelton (62 off 93), Bavuma (58 off 85) and Stubbs (58 off 120) displayed their class with the bat, with a variety of shots catching eyes as the Proteas aim to go all-out to secure their first ICC trophy since 1998.
There were suggestions that the Proteas had zeroed in on Wiaan Mulder as their No. 3 batter, with the player walking out after Markram’s loss early in the innings. He added 26 runs during his resolute knock at the crease.
As several batters opted to retire hurt not out, as many as nine South Africa batters got an opportunity to feature in the first innings.
Walking in at six & seven respectively were Tony de Zorzi and David Bedingham, who contributed with 28 and 23 in Arundel.
Following South Africa’s declaration at 313/2, Zimbabwe’s time with the bat got off to a shaky start with Kagiso Rabada getting rid of Brian Bennett for 15.
Rabada and Jansen warmed up quite well with the ball, with the duo sharing the opening eight overs and were looking in fine shape as Zimbabwe concluded the day at 48/1 with Nicholas Welch and Sean Williams on the wicket.
With two more days of play left, the Proteas will be vying for more valuable time on the field to fine-tune themselves ahead of the challenge against Australia.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/proteas-batters-dominate-opening-day-in-zimbabwe-warm-up/,2025-05-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Zimbabwe deploys drones along Mozambique border to curb smuggling - report,"The drones, operational since May 1, 2025, are being used extensively along key smuggling hotspots, including the Forbes Border Post, which links Manicaland Province to Mozambique’s Manica Province. The new surveillance initiative has reportedly led to a decline in smuggling activities and an increase in arrests.
Zimbabwe’s Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, confirmed the development and praised the role drones are playing in bolstering border security.
“We have seen a notable decline in smuggling cases. Our security forces are vigilant and on top of the situation, thanks to the added surveillance capabilities provided by the drones,” said Mugadza. “They are also serving as a deterrent and helping to identify individuals involved in illegal activities.”
The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority’s (ZIMRA) acting Commissioner for Customs and Excise, Mr Adrian Swarres, echoed Mugadza’s sentiments, highlighting the strategic benefits of drone technology.
“Drones offer rapid deployment and real-time intelligence. With a borderline of over 700 kilometres, drones have dramatically increased the area under surveillance and reduced the need for extensive ground patrols,” he said.
Police have also seen a rise in smuggling-related arrests. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka, confirmed the trend, though he said specific figures were not immediately available.
Field investigations by The Manica Post show that the crackdown has led some former smugglers to abandon the illicit trade. Dudzai Macheso, from Hauna in Honde Valley, said he had quit smuggling bales of second-hand clothes and opened a grocery shop instead.
“Smuggling has become too risky with drones watching the border. I decided to start a legitimate business,” said Macheso.
Meanwhile, authorities are not only relying on technology. A special police taskforce recently engaged in a fatal shootout with suspected smugglers, resulting in three arrests and the seizure of vehicles and contraband, including bales of clothing and shoes valued at thousands of dollars.
Infrastructure
During a recent inspection of Forbes Border Post, Zimbabwe’s Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube announced infrastructure development plans.
“We have concessioned the redevelopment of Forbes Border Post to private investors who have demonstrated their capabilities at Beitbridge. We expect a modern and efficient facility,” said Ncube.
The revamp is part of a broader government strategy to introduce computerised and online border management systems at all ports of entry, aimed at improving efficiency, curbing corruption, and strengthening border control.
Zimbabwe’s Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe recently announced the rollout of an integrated border management system that will link civil registry, police, and immigration departments. Most of the necessary hardware is already in place, with the installation of e-gates pending.
“The system includes facial recognition technology and online automation to cut queues and reduce human error,” said Kazembe during a tour of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport immigration department.
Additionally, plans are underway to open new formal entry points at Honde Valley and Cashel Valley to help decongest Forbes Border Post.
Zimbabwe’s intensified focus on border control forms part of its wider national strategy to enhance security, streamline trade, and improve the travel experience for both citizens and visitors.

"Wary of Global Tensions, Zimbabwe Holds Interest Rates at 35%","Zimbabwe, wary of a rise in global tensions, resolved to leave its bank policy rate unchanged at 35%, according to John Mushayavanhu, the central bank governor.
“The MPC noted the broad-based deceleration of global growth occasioned by escalating trade tensions, geo-economic fragmentation, regional and international conflicts and policy uncertainty,” Mushayavanhu said in a statement Monday after a surprise meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. “Considering the challenging and rapidly evolving risks to the global growth outlook, the MPC advised the Reserve Bank to maintain a sufficiently tight monetary policy stance.”
The central bank was set to hold a rate setting meeting only later this month on June 27, according to a schedule available on its website. Despite, the current uncertain global environment, the bank said it still sees 6% growth in the domestic economy as achievable this year. The strong performance of agriculture is expected to help spur the expansion after improved output from key crops including corn, tobacco and cotton.
“Other sectors are also expected to record positive growth performance, benefiting from the prevailing price and exchange rate stability,” Mushayavanhu added.
The southern African nation has kept rates unchanged since it lifted them last September in response to a sharp devaluation of its gold-backed currency, the ZiG. Businesses have repeatedly asked the central bank to reconsider its tight monetary policy stance, which is causing a severe liquidity crunch in the economy.
The bank maintains that its policy has helped stabilize the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, and is seeing increased usage in the economy. It is now used in 43% of transactions in the economy up from 26% last April, according to the governor. The foreign currency reserves backing the ZiG stood at $701 million as of last Friday.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/wary-of-global-tensions-zimbabwe-holds-interest-rates-at-35/,2025-06-17 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Life after GNU,"Living expenses are getting high, bills such as electricity, water and phone have been going on unpaid for months as wages and salaries haven’t been paid in time or haven’t been paid at all.
For a family of five to have a proper meal per day, they will require $5 – $10. To commute between Glenview 8 and Eastlea surburb one will need $4 for a return journey per day – thus $20 per week and $80 per month. Given such figure it has become almost impossible for workers to afford commuting on a daily basis – hence most of female working class have resorted to prostitution to subsidize their income, hence the increase in STIs and HIV/AIDS.
As I write most the streets in Harare CBD are filled with homeless kids as their families have been wiped out by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
All the efforts made by the GNU government have been lost as Zanu (PF) has returned the country to their old ways of plunder. The little gains of GNU have started to disappear as the international community cannot trust Mugabe or his lieutenants.
If Mugabe stays another term, Zimbabwe will become a ghost country as most of the towns and cities are now a shadow of their past. Cities like Kadoma and Kwekwe have been suffocated and are now in intensive care as their infrastructure has deteriorated. – Ephraim Chinana, London

Zimbabwe says gold-backed currency stable but investor doubts persist,"HARARE – Zimbabwe’s gold-backed currency now has more than 100 percent reserve cover and is stable, according to the central bank, but doubts over its credibility remain, underscored by a persistent premium in the parallel market.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on Monday kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 35 percent, citing a stable exchange rate, opens new tab as one of the reasons, and reported total reserves of $701 million. The bank said the portion of transactions carried out using the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency surged to 43 percent in May from 26 percent in April 2024, the month it was introduced.
Decades of economic instability and currency devaluations mean most people still use the U.S. dollar for most purchases. But the authorities are hoping the ZiG’s gold backing will give Zimbabweans the confidence to adopt it for everyday transactions.
“ZiG is our national currency, and as the central bank, we are committed to ensuring its success by maintaining all the fundamental characteristics of sound money, including its function as a reliable store of value,” Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavanhu wrote in response to Reuters’ questions.
“The Reserve Bank has learned from previous currency failures that maintaining optimum money supply and ensuring monetary stability is vital,” he added.
Despite the bank’s assurances, the gap between the official exchange rate and parallel market rate remains about 20 percent.
“The rate has been stable for more than three months,” said black-market trader Pearson Tambudze, attributing the stability to a scarcity of the local currency rather than restored confidence.
“There isn’t a lot of ZiG in the market,” he said.
The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the ZiG’s stability but is urging Zimbabwe to adopt tighter money-growth limits, a more transparent foreign exchange market and to make progress on clearing an estimated $12.2 billion in external arrears.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, meanwhile, expressed hope last month that currency stability and appropriate monetary policy would enable Zimbabwe to raise $2.6 billion in bridge finance by mid-2026.
Investors, however, remain cautious.
“We wouldn’t invest in Zimbabwe at the current stages. The country needs to have a lot more development before we would consider it,” said Jetro Siekkinen at LGT Capital Partners.
Economists also flagged concerns over Zimbabwe’s reserve cushion, which stands at 0.8 months of import cover, well short of the IMF’s recommended three-month safety net.
“In terms of priority, I would consider the clearance of arrears with multilateral creditors to be most important,” said Lyle Begbie, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Two earlier IMF staff-monitored programmes collapsed within 15 months, and Begbie predicted similar outcomes for future efforts.
“Ultimately, we are likely years away from the IMF providing concessional financing to Zimbabwe, even if the country does everything right, which itself is not likely,” he said. – Reuters

Styling tips for portrait shoots,"What the mirror cannot always see is often conjured up somewhat uncharmingly by the camera. The camera perceives small blemishes more strongly than is the case in reality. We’ll tell you how to apply your make-up for a professional photo shoot. You can bet that you will look perfectly fine.
SPECIAL FEATURES
Even before a photo shoot, questions about the location and the light should be clarified. Depending on the chosen light source, colors will look completely different in the photos. This is especially true for make-up. Sunlight, for example, accentuates colors, make-up mistakes, and small skin blemishes more than studio lighting. Make-up should therefore never be too strong in daylight shots. If, on the other hand, it is a studio shoot with artificial light sources, the make-up can also be stronger, as the light swallows up colors.
TIPS AND TRICKS
Good photo makeup starts with the right preparation. It is advisable not to experiment with new skincare or cosmetic products before a photo shoot. Skin irritations and minor inflammations cannot always be removed with makeup. Eyebrows should also not be plucked immediately before the shoot. A good foundation is recommended to optimally prepare the skin for the makeup. Therefore, use a light day cream tailored to your skin type.
THE COMPLEXION
An even complexion is the be-all and end-all for professional photo make-up. A well-covering foundation or even camouflage make-up is therefore highly recommended. When selecting products, make sure that the product does not have UV protection to avoid reflective spots when using flash and that the shade of the make-up matches your skin tone. You should also make sure that the make-up matches your skin needs. If you tend to have dry skin, for example, you should not use mattifying makeup as this will dry out your skin even more, which will not look good in the photos.
For a natural finish, apply the foundation using a small make-up sponge. Work the foundation into the skin with patting movements and finish by mattifying your forehead, the bridge of your nose and your chin with a translucent powder. During a shoot, these areas tend to shine more quickly than the cheeks, for example.
Photo make-up: Contouring
To give your face more contour and, therefore, more three-dimensionality for the later photos, it is now important to contour the face correctly with a contour powder. This technique is often used by professional make-up artists so that the face does not look too flat in the pictures later. First take a contour powder that is a few shades darker than your actual skin tone and a slanted brush and use it to emphasize the areas under your cheekbones, the temples and the upper forehead up to the hairline. When applying, make sure that the lines do not look too harsh. This is best achieved by blending the product in well.
Depending on your type, you can go for a light pink or a subtle peach shade on your cheeks. This will make you look very fresh and natural in the photos. To give your face even more three-dimensionality, use a highlighter. For the best result, we recommend a liquid highlighter, as this looks the most natural. Apply it with your finger to the upper cheekbones, the bridge of the nose, and the lip line. This will make these areas stand out better in the photos later on. You can see which areas you should contour for great photo make-up in our graphic.
CONTOURING
Tips for portrait shots in black and white
If your photo shoot is a black-and-white shoot, you should be aware that these are not as flattering to the skin as color shots. In this case, the photo make-up requires stronger contours and a stronger emphasis on the lips, cheeks and eyes. It should also be noted that scars, skin problems and wrinkles are much more noticeable in black and white photos than in color photos. It is, therefore, advisable to use high-coverage make-up that does not dry out your skin.
THE EYES
Emphasize your eyes
The eyes take center stage, especially in portrait shots. Your make-up should therefore emphasize them well. The stronger the color you choose, the more defined your eyes will appear. Also, use black mascara, which you apply in several layers. You can also highlight your eyebrows with a matching eyebrow pencil.
Highlight your eye color with the right eyeshadow:
Brown eyes: You can choose all kinds of colors for brown eyes. Shades of pink and violet make the eye color stand out particularly well.
Blue eyes: For blue eyes, choose warm shades such as peach, golden brown, or champagne. These balance out the cool blue.
Green eyes: Shades of pink or brown are suitable for highlighting green eyes.
To make your eyes look expressive, you should use three different shades of color. Before you apply the colors, you can optionally use an eye primer. It serves as a primer and makes the colors look even stronger.
Then, apply the middle shade to the entire eyelid first. Apply the lightest shade to the inner corner of the eye. Use the dark shade only on the outer eyelid. Then, use a soft brush to lightly blend all the shades to create a gentle transition.

Zimbabwe suffer defeat in Test warm-up against County XI,"Zimbabwe will go into next week’s one-off Test against England on the back of a 138-run defeat to an unheralded Professional County Club Select XI after they failed to bat out the final day in Leicester.
Set a target of 392 after the PCC XI declared on 464 for 7 an hour into the final day, Zimbabwe slipped to 51 for 4 shortly after lunch, Hampshire’s Eddie Jack knocking over three of the top four. Nick Welch counterpunched, adding 47 with Wessly Madhevere, whose 93 had steered Zimbabwe to a first-innings total of 403, and 70 with Tafadzwa Tsiga, as the tourists reached tea five down.
But Welch couldn’t convert his innings to three figures as Essex allrounder Jamal Richards struck twice during the evening session, and although Tsiga went past 50 for the second time in the match, spinners Dan Mousley and Jafar Chohan plucked out the last three wickets to condemn Zimbabwe to defeat.
Mousley had earlier scored a second-innings 154, putting on a stand of 179 with captain Josh De Caires as the PCC XI swiftly overcame a first-innings deficit of 73. De Caires, who top-scored with 79 after electing to bat on day one, added 84 before being stumped by Tsiga off Wellington Masakadza. Mousley was later joined in reaching a hundred by Thomas Rew, as the PCC XI accelerated towards their declaration.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/zimbabwe-suffer-defeat-in-test-warm-up-against-county-xi/,2025-05-19 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,
‘We are a passionately multiracial team’: Zimbabwe return to England transformed,"Twenty-two years is a long time, even in a sport that measures its games in days and its history in centuries. The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing director’s job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and Wales Cricket Board was just about to launch the world’s very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.
They have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.
“Despite all the politics, despite all the chaos that we’ve been through, cricket is now a national game,” says David Coltart, “supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races.” Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirai’s coalition government.
More than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. “I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion,” he says, “I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.”
When Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against “the death of democracy” in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. “My sadness is that Henry and Andy didn’t stay in the country,” he says, “because they remain hugely influential figures. It’s not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them.” He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, but who died in 2023. “Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers who’d been dispossessed of their land.”
For Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. “We punch above our weight.” Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.
“It was very necessary,” Coltart says. “Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable.” He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. “The land holdings were unjust,” he says, “But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasn’t violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.”
When Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. “They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, I’ve never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe,” Coltart says. “Although I’m a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, I’ve always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.”
Even now, he would be against a boycott of Afghan cricket on similar grounds. “Because if the players and the board members themselves are trying to do the right thing but are being constrained by the government, then you’ve got to support them and encourage them, not boycott them. Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.”
He is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host the Street Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. “There’s still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that we’re not spending the money that we get as best we should. I’m a politician, but I don’t think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. I’d like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.”
Still, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. “Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. It’s a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and that’s a wonderful projection of our country.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/we-are-a-passionately-multiracial-team-zimbabwe-return-to-england-transformed/,2025-05-20 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,

Women behind the lens: ‘This is how I see Zimbabwe - thriving in the face of challenges’,"I took this image, titled Lotus, of Rosebud Tsikira – a model, award-winning makeup artist and colleague – in a recreational park in Harare, Zimbabwe. I chose the location because the lotus flower emerges here from murky waters and, despite difficult living conditions, produces beautiful blooms.
This is how I view Zimbabwe and our people because we are inherently strong and resourceful. We have a deep well of creativity and perseverance that allows us to thrive even in the face of challenges.
Rosebud’s spirit, like the lotus, reflects resilience and liberation. Her boldness is reflected in the way she commands attention from the camera. She is holding an African staff which is symbolic of authority, dominance and presence.
I created Rosebud’s African-Victorian dress with my designer, blending Victorian style with African wax print. The pattern on the fabric mirrors the shape of the Lotus plants.
I use African prints in every shoot. They show how cultures and communities connect: people share them as gifts, buy them as souvenirs, or wear them while travelling. My photography is about making connections too – between dreams and reality, and between the past, present, and future. Photography’s magic is capturing fleeting moments and making them last for ever.
Lotus is part of a larger project entitled Birds of a Paradise, representing everyday people from contemporary life in Zimbabwe – and new beginnings. This image captures the transformative power of new beginnings – the lotus that started off as a seed and is now in full bloom; the light reflecting on the lotus leaves; Rosebud standing strong – and signifies hope on the horizon for us Zimbabweans.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/06/women-behind-the-lens-this-is-how-i-see-zimbabwe-thriving-in-the-face-of-challenges/,2024-04-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,

"Drought imperils Zimbabwe’s ancient rock art, spurring efforts to preserve and date it","THE MATOBO HILLS IN ZIMBABWE—Sketched onto the walls of a granite outcropping in the hills of southern Zimbabwe, tall, rust-red human figures gather around groups of antelopes and giraffes. The painting, along with more than 3000 others in the area, portrays animals spiritually important to the nomadic San people who created them sometime between 2000 and 13,000 years ago. This pictorial record of San culture in the Matobo Hills is one of Africa’s highest concentrations of rock art; it was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003.
But the paintings are under threat from vandalism as well as erosion. Now, a nonprofit group near the hills is working with local people to document and raise awareness of the rock art before it disappears. Since July, the Amagugu International Heritage Centre (AIHC), based in the village of Whitewater near the southern city of Bulawayo, has been collaborating with the U.S. embassy in Zimbabwe and the country’s national museum to record local stories about the art, identify new sites, and develop a catalog of artworks that can be analyzed by experts even if the original paintings fade. The team plans to release a final catalog and a documentary about the project in January 2025.
Preserving the art is essential to understanding the ancient societies that created it, said Ancila Nhamo, a professor of archaeology at the University of Zimbabwe working on the project. “Art is a product of the mind and the culture, which is an intangible thing,” she said. “But when you get the art, you can get into the minds of these people and really see what the world was like at that time.”
This year, Zimbabwe has undergone one of the worst droughts in living memory, with maximum temperatures 2°C to 5°C above normal. Hot, dry weather boosts the risk of wildfires and kills vegetation, increasing soil erosion and making rock art sites more prone to flooding during the rainy season, as researchers in nearby Namibia have found.
The paintings are also vulnerable to vandalism, such as graffiti, and damage from fires, which are sometimes set by locals unaware of the paintings’ importance. Unlike previous efforts led by outsiders, this project aims to inspire a sense of ownership over and responsibility for the sites among local people. “The [local residents] are the people who should play a part in preserving, documenting, and protecting this cultural heritage,” said Allington Ndlovu, a program manager at AIHC.
The people in the area today are mostly farmers of the Ndebele ethnic group, whose ancestors migrated from the north in several waves starting about 4000 years ago. The ancient Ndebele interacted with the nomadic San, whose descendants still live in some parts of Zimbabwe and in South Africa. Today, San people feel the rock art can help them understand their heritage, said Davy Ndlovu, director of the Tsoro-o-tso San Development Trust, a Zimbabwean nongovernment organization that advocates for the rights of the Indigenous group. “The cultural heritage of the San is critically endangered and there is very little awareness around the issue,” Ndlovu said. “Projects like this can assist the San to get their voices heard … and assist coming generations to understand the heritage of Zimbabwe.”
The project organizers worked with local leaders to train 35 women from seven villages in drawing and painting techniques. The local artists then replicated 35 artworks using pencils, brushes, and paint, creating a visual record now displayed in a community gallery. Fourteen of the largest and clearest rock paintings were reproduced on canvas and granite slates, to be displayed in the country’s national gallery.
Meanwhile, a joint French-Zimbabwean research project called MATOBART is working to date rock art in the Matobo Hills. The paint is made of inorganic material so it can’t be radiocarbon dated, said project leader Camille Bourdier of the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès. Instead, she and other researchers set out to date stone tools, including palettes likely used to create the paintings, and flakes of paint that fell to the ground. They hope to estimate minimum ages by directly dating the sediment around these artifacts.
Preliminary findings confirm earlier estimates made by archaeologists in the 1980s, who suggested the paintings were created starting about 13,000 years ago. More precise dating will allow researchers to more accurately interpret the art, Nhamo said. For instance, rock art in Zimbabwe mainly depicts kudu antelopes, she says, whereas similar San sites in nearby South Africa focus on another antelope, the eland. Nhamo would like to know whether San people painted different animals over time, or distinct San groups valued particular animals as markers of community identity, a way to distinguish themselves from their neighbors.
Other interpretations focus on the spiritual, rather than social, importance of the animals, said Sam Challis, who heads the Rock Art Research Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand. San people started to paint “richly embellished” eland at sites in the Drakensberg Mountains during a period of cooler climate that began around 1500 B.C.E., when the animals—previously a staple food source—were becoming more scarce, as Challis and anthropologist Brian Stewart of the University of Michigan wrote in a 2023 paper. They argue that by painting the eland, the San were attempting to harness the antelope’s spiritual powers to summon more of them to appear during a time of scarcity.
The artworks now being documented in the Matobo Hills, including scenes of antelopes, elephants, and gnus surrounded by humans walking with bows and arrows and dancing or sitting, could yield similar insights for future researchers, Bourdier said. “These [San] hunter-gatherers have been living this way for tens of thousands of years. … It has proven to be a very sustainable way of living,” she said. “Unraveling these ways of living within the world could give us some clues of the type of behaviors or relationships we could go back to.”

Travel and Tourism,"k up conversation with the barman and quickly learned he too was from Zim.
Shonglish flowed soon after as we chatted about the inevitable. My new friend was from the Falls where he had worked at a Lodge, “You know,” he said as he gestured toward the foreign patrons having dinner, “these Europeans, they come all the way from Europe to Cape Town on holiday and all they see is what they have at home; beaches, restaurants, mountains and over-priced shops.” I nodded in agreement with a wry smile. Cape Town was voted best holiday destination by Europe’s leading travel magazine in 2005. “If only I could take them to Zimbabwe and show them the land of milk and honey and what real service is about,” he said.
The conviction he spoke with and the longing he showed to want to showcase his country made me realise that Zimbabwe still has a great deal to offer.
The Falls will always be the 7th Wonder of the World – regardless of who is in power. Tiger fishing on a houseboat trip, canoeing down the Zambesi River or golfing in Nyanga is still all possible. And the downstream benefits from tourism to many suffering Zimbabweans are considerable. By choosing to holiday in Zimbabwe, you could put food on a family’s table, provide medicine for a sick child and give somebody a meaningful day’s work.
Venues4Africa.com has teamed up with The Zimbabwean to showcase ‘the land of milk and honey’. When planning your holiday you might need to take your own cows and bees, but you are still guaranteed the only truly African holiday with unrivalled service at a fraction of the cost. – Venues4Africa.com rian@venues4africa.com

Life after GNU,"Living expenses are getting high, bills such as electricity, water and phone have been going on unpaid for months as wages and salaries haven’t been paid in time or haven’t been paid at all.
For a family of five to have a proper meal per day, they will require $5 – $10. To commute between Glenview 8 and Eastlea surburb one will need $4 for a return journey per day – thus $20 per week and $80 per month. Given such figure it has become almost impossible for workers to afford commuting on a daily basis – hence most of female working class have resorted to prostitution to subsidize their income, hence the increase in STIs and HIV/AIDS.
As I write most the streets in Harare CBD are filled with homeless kids as their families have been wiped out by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
All the efforts made by the GNU government have been lost as Zanu (PF) has returned the country to their old ways of plunder. The little gains of GNU have started to disappear as the international community cannot trust Mugabe or his lieutenants.
If Mugabe stays another term, Zimbabwe will become a ghost country as most of the towns and cities are now a shadow of their past. Cities like Kadoma and Kwekwe have been suffocated and are now in intensive care as their infrastructure has deteriorated. – Ephraim Chinana, London

Former Cubs great Sammy Sosa, who once was the face of Chicago’s Friendly Confines, made his long-anticipated return to the place he used to hit towering home runs and flash his big smile. Slammin’ Sammy, as he was affectionately called, is remembered from when he and Mark McGwire captivated the nation in 1998 as the pair battled to break Roger Maris’ longstanding single-season home run record. Sosa – who won National League MVP honors that year – finished with 66 home runs and McGwire – who hit 70 homers to set the mark at the time – both later became embroiled in allegations of steroid use. Sosa, a fan favorite whose sprints to his usual right field position ahead of first pitch brought joy and cheers to those sitting in the bleachers, had remained away from Wrigley Field since 2004, when, after 13 seasons, the slugger’s diminishing performances led to a falling out with the organization and his previously adoring fans. Those hard feelings have all but disappeared judging by the scenes that played out on Friday. Read more: https://cnn.it/4kNH7gT
When “Jaws” started filming in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1974, all signs pointed to disaster. The mechanical figures, meant to portray the massive white shark that terrorizes Amity Island, kept failing, delaying production and frustrating the cast and crew. Director Steven Spielberg was then just 26 and new to big-budget filmmaking. Filming on the ocean, coupled with mechanical shark problems, caused production to run late and over budget. The production was so fraught that it inspired a play, written by star Richard Shaw’s son, aptly titled “The Shark is Broken.” And yet. “Jaws” was a massive hit, becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time. It invented the concept of the summer blockbuster. It was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards and won three, including one for composer John Williams’ now-iconic score. And its masterful control of suspense has inspired countless copycats. Even 50 years after its premiere, “Jaws” still thrills audiences — and its tumultuous production is still legendary.

In almost cartoon-like fashion, the Montreal Canadiens left the trophy on the side of the road after winning it in 1924. The story goes that a car carrying some of the team had stalled going up a hill, meaning players had to get out to push. It wasn’t until they reached the top that they realized they had left one of the most famous trophies in the world behind!
Prized possession
The Stanley Cup is looked after by a team of people with the title of “Keeper of the Cup.” These people travel with the trophy, keeping it clean and, more importantly, safe. At least one member of the team is always with the trophy when it's in public. “We get called different things too. People have fun with it. They call us Cup keepers, Cup dudes, Cup guys. You know, handlers is all kinds of terms, but in essence, we're basically babysitting the Cup,” Howie Burrow, Keeper of the Cup, told CNN Sports.
Edmonton Oilers
It’s only natural that players want to party after finally getting their hands on the trophy and that seemed to be the case with the Edmonton Oilers following the magical final series in 1987, where the Oilers blew a 3-1 series lead, but managed to pull off the win in Game 7 against the Philadelphia Flyers. Led by Mark Messier, both on and off the ice, the Oilers reportedly went partying to celebrate and accidentally damaged the Stanley Cup over the course of the night, requiring repairs before being returned.
Global tour
The Stanley Cup has traveled to dozens of countries around the world, including places such as Afghanistan, Japan, Scotland and the UAE. It doesn’t get a first-class seat, though. Instead, it flies underneath the airplane in a very secure box. “When I'm getting my boarding passes, I'll open it up to show whoever's checking me in, but soon as I do that, there's usually about a dozen people in the other lines going, ‘Oh my God, that's a Stanley Cup. Can I get a photo? Can I touch it?’” Burrow told CNN.
Pittsburgh Penguins
One thing the trophy’s handlers insist on is that the Cup shouldn’t get wet – although that didn’t stop the Pittsburgh Penguins. Now legendary photos show the team celebrating with the trophy in Canadian star Mario Lemieux’s swimming pool. Luckily, though, it seems like the trophy floated.
All shapes and sizes
The Stanley Cup we see today has been the same shape since 1948, but it hasn’t always looked the same. The first ever iteration of the trophy, back in 1892, was just a bowl and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. Over the years, more tiers have been added to it and now the Cup stands at 35.25 inches and weighs 34.5 pounds. “If you have to hang on to it for a long time and say, you have to walk a block or two because you're following somebody, it does get heavy. You're switching arms, or you got to put it down. You can work up a good sweat. But when the players first win it, right after on the ice, I mean, I'm sure it weighs hardly anything to them,” Burrow said to CNN.
New York Rangers
It seems even animals can enjoy the “People’s trophy.” In 1994, a photo was taken of Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin eating out of the trophy while at New York’s Belmont Park. New York Rangers star Eddie Olczyk was rumored to be behind the stunt, but he’s since denied responsibility.
Etched into history
Each player of the winning team has their name etched into a band which is then placed onto the trophy – with older bands being retired through the years. Given the number of winners, it’s not surprising that a few spelling mistakes have creeped onto the prestigious Cup.
Detroit Red Wings
What’s the worst thing you could imagine happening to – or in – the Stanley Cup? Well, this might be it. When Kris Draper had his day with the trophy, he celebrated by putting his baby daughter in the Cup for a photo. Only she left behind a little surprise… by using the legendary trophy as a toilet.
Summer tour
Since 1995, every player who wins the Stanley Cup is allowed a day to celebrate with it – sometimes two – in any way they deem fit. The trophy is then returned to NHL trustees before the new season, meaning every team bids to win the prestigious trophy again.
Pittsburgh Penguins
Forward Josh Archibald got creative and used his time with the Cup to baptize his son. Three-week-old Brecken was photographed receiving his blessing while sitting in the bowl at the top of the trophy. Quite the experience for someone not even a month out in the world.
Record winners
No team in history has gotten its hands on the Stanley Cup more than the Montreal Canadiens. The Habs have won it 24 times, including a record five-in-a-row from 1956 to 1960. The franchise's first win came in 1916 – before the NHL even ran the tournament. The Canadiens haven't won it since 1993, though, and last reached the final in 2021.
Washington Capitals
In 2018, Capitals defenseman Dmitry Orlov decided to celebrate with the trophy in his hometown, the southwestern Siberian city of Novokuznetsk. The Cup had to take a myriad of connecting flights to reach the destination and you can probably guess what happened. The trophy missed one of its flights and was left behind in Moscow. A helicopter was chartered in order to reclaim it quickly!",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2025/06/04/sport/stanley-cup-nhl-history-spt/,2025-06-04 00:00:00,cnn,sports,"CNN,Ben Church,Agne Jurkenaite,Marco Chacon,Alicia Johnson"
Here’s what Trump has promised to do in a second term,"Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks. The former president has also talked about reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, from 21% – but only for companies that make their products in the US.
“I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history,” the former president said earlier this year at the Black Conservative Federation’s Honors Gala in South Carolina. “We’ll make it permanent and give you a new economic boom.”
I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history.”
In September, Trump said he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.
“That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said at a rally in Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”
This summer, during a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Trump also pledged to end taxes on tips, a move targeted to appeal to hundreds of thousands of people working in the city. It’s a promise Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News in a November 10 interview that he plans to implement on Day One.
The former president has also promised to stop taxing Social Security benefits. He has yet to outline a proposal to replace the lost revenue, which could harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget.
He announced in November that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump had previously proposed as a way to reduce government spending. The commission will “develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months,” Trump said in September remarks at the Economic Club of New York.
The former president has also announced plans to get rid of the $10,000 limit on state and local tax, or SALT, deductions that he signed into law as part of his 2017 tax cuts. Reversing this cap would largely affect higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions.
In an early October speech, Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible. He also vowed in an October video to end the double taxation on Americans who live abroad. This move could stop some Americans living abroad from having to pay taxes to both the US and to the country where they live. He has not provided details on how such relief would work.
Trump has also pledged to repeal Biden’s tax hikes, “immediately tackle” inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. He has promised to rescind all unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which put in place a wide array of climate measures and funneled about $80 billion over 10 years to the Internal Revenue Service.
In an effort to address housing affordability, Trump has floated a ban on mortgages for undocumented immigrants, claiming that they push up housing costs. CNN has reported that undocumented immigrants, however, make up a tiny portion of the mortgage market.
To help “working Americans” catch up on credit card debt, Trump promised in September to temporarily cap interest rates on credit cards at 10%. The average credit card rate is just under 21%, while the average rate on retail store cards is a record high 30.45%.
At a late October rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he also said he would support a tax credit for family caregivers. He has not outlined details about who would be eligible, how large it would be and whether the cost would be covered.
In February, Trump pledged to impose “stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.”
“It’s called you screw us, and we screw you,” Trump said at a South Carolina rally.
Under his proposed “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,” the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose “a reciprocal, identical” tariff right back.
It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs.
It’s called you screw us, and we screw you.”
As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called “America First” trade agenda. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and stop China from buying up America and US companies from investing in China.
Since winning the election, Trump has promised to put a new 25% tariff on all products coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods by 10%, on the first day of his administration -- in retaliation for illegal immigration and drugs coming across the border. On January 14, 2025, Trump said he will create an “External Revenue Service” on Day One of his presidency to collect tariffs and all revenue from “foreign sources.”
At one point earlier this year, Trump had said he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He has also called for adding a tariff of at least 10% on all imports from all countries. At an August campaign event in North Carolina, he suggested that the across-the-board tariff could be as high as 20%.
In September, Trump floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico. He claimed this would stop Chinese companies from building auto plants in Mexico as a way to avoid US tariffs, which he could impose by executive action.
Trump has also repeatedly expressed interest in ending the federal income tax, pointing to the late 19th century, when the US relied on tariffs to fund federal spending.
“When we were a smart country, in the 1890s … this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said in late October.
Earlier in October, Trump announced he would invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was signed into law in January 2020 as a replacement for NAFTA.
The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. “Economic security is national security,” he said.
Trump made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border in February, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.
In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the “Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.”
“We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,” he wrote.
In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” a plan Trump has said he’d launch on Day One in the White House.
We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.”
In October, Trump said he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to create a federal program to expedite the removal of undocumented gang members. He also warned that ""if they come back into our country, they will be told it is an automatic 10-year sentence in jail with no possibility of parole.” CNN has reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement already deports individuals who pose a national security or public safety threat once ordered removed by an immigration judge.
Later that month, Trump promised to create a “compensation fund” for victims of crimes committed by migrants by using assets seized from gangs and drug cartels.
Also in October, during a rally in Arizona, Trump promised to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents, provide a 10% salary raise and offer a $10,000 retention and signing bonus. His comments came months after Senate Republicans, at his urging, blocked a bipartisan border measure that would have cleared the way for more Border Patrol agents.
Separately, last summer, Trump proposed “automatically” giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges — comments that break from his efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration while in office. In May 2024, Trump said that on Day One of his presidency he would issue an executive order, “making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward,“ children born to undocumented immigrants would not automatically gain US citizenship.
After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of “Hamas’ sympathizers.”
“We’ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that’s OK with you,” he added.
Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republican senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.
“Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,” he said.
“It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,” he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. But when asked during September’s debate with Harris about whether he has a plan to replace Obamacare, he replied, “I have concepts of a plan.”
Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration.”
Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president’s pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.
On the abortion issue, Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that laws should be decided by states.
“The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in an April recording posted to his Truth Social platform.
Trump also said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions.
In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for.
Since winning the election, Trump said he’ll nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pushed vaccine conspiracy theories, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump had said in late October that he’d let his former political rival “go wild on health.”
Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing “radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.”
“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump said in June 2023 remarks. “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.”
Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove “rogue” bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress.
I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”
To address what he labeled the “disturbing” relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data.
Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from “colluding” to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in “censorship-supporting activities.”
In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council’s Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges.
“I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,” he said.
Trump has also pledged to “appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.”
In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been “unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.” Trump noted that he wanted to “study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.”
It’s a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection on the US Capitol, which he has repeatedly pledged that he would execute on Day One (though it’s not clear who among the hundreds of convicted rioters, defendants awaiting trial and remaining fugitives would receive clemency, CNN has reported).
At the Libertarian Convention in May, Trump also promised to release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the online black market Silk Road who is serving a life sentence in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking. Trump declined to commute Ulbricht’s sentence during his presidency.
*Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns
Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases.
“We’re going to ‘drill, baby, drill’ right away,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, in January, a refrain he repeated often on the campaign trail throughout 2024.
At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports.
Trump said in a January 6, 2025 interview he would try to undo on Day One an action that President Joe Biden took to permanently ban future offshore oil and gas development in parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Biden’s action invoked the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act -- a law that gives presidents broad authority to withdraw federal waters from future oil and gas development and that doesn’t explicitly allow presidents to use actions to put waters back into development. Trump would need Congress to change that law before he could act on his proposed reversal.
The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign.
As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.”
In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on Day One.”
Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive because servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions in order to receive the cryptocurrency as a reward.
At a cryptocurrency conference in July, the former president promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US.
“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said, adding that he would create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.”
On the campaign trail, he also vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has pushed to regulate the industry. Gensler has said he’ll step down on January 20, 2025, which made room for the president-elect to announce he will select Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, to run the agency.",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/trump-campaign-promises-dg/,2025-01-15 00:00:00,cnn,politics,CNN

Explaining press traps in football,"Those who enjoy 1xBet sports betting Uganda can also wager on teams that have different strategies.
Within this system, “press traps” are a clever tactical tool teams use to regain possession high up the pitch. A press trap is essentially a deliberate setup by the defending team to lure the opponent into a specific area of the field, only to aggressively press him once they enter it. There are 3 objectives that can be achieved with this:
isolate the ball carrier;
limit his passing options;
and force a mistake.
Something to enjoy when making sports betting at 1xBet Uganda is to wager on teams with great defensive setups.
How it works
Press traps often start by letting the opponent believe he has a safe passing route. Defenders may slightly back off or subtly invite a pass to a certain player or side. For example, a team might allow the opponent’s full-back to receive the ball near the touchline. Once the ball is played there, multiple players quickly swarm the receiver, doing 2 things: cutting off nearby options and boxing them in against the sideline, where there’s less space to maneuver. A foot bet today can be made at 1xBet on various things that happen during football matches too.
There are several types of press traps. One common version is the touchline trap, where the sideline acts as an “extra defender.” Another is the central trap, which is riskier but highly rewarding, where a team tempts the opponent to play into the middle before collapsing on the ball carrier. You are always invited to try a foot ball bet today at the 1xBet website on the best defenders from world football.
Some teams also use back pass traps, encouraging a pass to the goalkeeper or center-backs under pressure, leading to rushed clearances or turnovers.
Tricking the opponent
Executing a press trap successfully requires 3 ingredients: coordination, communication, and timing. All pressing players must move as a unit to cut off passing lanes without leaving gaps elsewhere. If even 1 player mistimes the press, the opponent can easily break through and exploit the space left behind. A good reason to register 1xBet is to be able to bet on teams who succeed in using press traps.
Press traps are most famously used by teams that play high-energy, aggressive football, like Arne Slot’s Liverpool or Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. However, they are not limited to the top clubs. Even lower-league and youth teams use simplified versions of press traps to great effect. All football fans are invited to register at 1xBet, where among other things, they will be able to bet on Liverpool, Manchester City and other teams too.

England pummel Zimbabwe in run fest at Trent Bridge,"NOTTINGHAM, England – Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope scored centuries to take England to a massive 498 for three at the close on the first day of their one-off test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge on Thursday.
Having pummelled the visitors’ military medium seam attack, Pope will resume on 169 from 163 balls with Harry Brook unbeaten on 10 as the home side scored at 5.66 runs an over in a dominant display in Zimbabwe’s first test in England for 22 years.
Opener Duckett smashed 140 from 134 balls before he was caught at cover by Ben Curran off the bowling of Wessly Madhevere after putting on an opening stand of 231 with Crawley in 41.3 overs.
The latter was more measured but reached a first test century in almost two years with 124 from 171 balls before he was trapped leg before wicket by spinner Sikandar Raza playing across the line.
Crawley added 137 in 142 deliveries for the second wicket with Pope as Zimbabwe’s tame seamers failed to find a consistent line and length, and offered up far too many half-volleys and width that was easily punished.
“It is a fantastic feeling to score a test hundred and a great day for the team as well,” Crawley told Sky Sports. “With Ben playing as well as he did, I didn’t feel a heap of pressure. And then Ollie came in and played the same way.
“I always want a big score and I was disappointed when I got out because there were more runs there for the taking.”
Joe Root passed 13,000 test runs before he attempted a hook off Blessing Muzarabani and was caught at deep fine leg by Sean Williams for 34.
Pope will be eyeing his highest test score of 205 on Friday with England looking to bat once in the four-day match as they prepare for the series against India and later on the Ashes in Australia.
Pope and Crawley have been short of runs in recent times, and with Jacob Bethell an option to come into the side, their centuries could not have been better timed, even if they came against a modest test attack.
“You feel part of the team again, you don’t want to feel like you are hanging on,” Crawley said. “There are certain times you feel like you are playing for your place and I have certainly felt that loads of times in my career.
“There are so many great players in this team that you try and match them and keep up with them.”
Zimbabwe were handicapped when Richard Ngarava, arguably the pick of their four pacemen with none for 42 in nine overs, left the field shortly after lunch having pulled up clutching his back and hamstrings when chasing a ball.
Ngarava returned late in the final session but did not bowl again before leaving the field once more.
Earlier, Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine won the toss and fielded in the hope his attack could utilise the cloud cover above Trent Bridge, a ground renowned for aiding pacemen.
His decision was all the more understandable given Zimbabwe’s 138-run thrashing by a youthful combined county side in their lone warm-up match last week.
But while Zimbabwe’s four quicks got the occasional ball to deviate sharply, they also repeatedly over-pitched and bowled too short. – Reuters/A

Zimbabwe want to host England at Victoria Falls,"England are in early discussions to tour Zimbabwe for the first time since 2004, with a new ground near Victoria Falls earmarked as the likely venue.
They have not played in the country since four one-day internationals 21 years ago, after cricket ties were severed in 2008 for political reasons.
Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) officials have used this week’s one-off Test at Trent Bridge to strengthen relations with their counterparts at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).
The possibility of a bilateral series on Zimbabwean soil in the next cycle of the Future Tours Programme (FTP) from 2027 to 2031 has been raised during talks between senior figures of the two boards.
Discussions are at a very early stage and there is no indication as to the format, or the number of matches, but sources have told BBC Sport they are “very optimistic” an agreement can be reached.
A bilateral white-ball series would appear the most likely option, but a one-off Test – potentially as a precursor to a longer Test tour of nearby South Africa – might hold more appeal to travelling England supporters.
The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority has been present at Trent Bridge, where they have been actively promoting the country as a holiday destination.
ZC is currently overseeing the construction of a new ground near Victoria Falls, named the Fale Mosi-oa-Tunya International Cricket Stadium, which it hopes will be a draw to visiting fans because of its location close to the waterfalls and safari excursions.
The 10,000-seater venue is being built with financial support from the International Cricket Council (ICC), at a cost between £4m and £8m, for the 2027 50-over World Cup which Zimbabwe is co-hosting with South Africa and Namibia.
ECB chief executive Richard Gould was among the delegates at a recent ICC board meeting in Zimbabwe which included a visit to Victoria Falls.
It is possible England could play in Zimbabwe at the 2027 World Cup, with the ICC yet to determine the schedule.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/zimbabwe-want-to-host-england-at-victoria-falls/,2025-05-26 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,

‘We are a passionately multiracial team’: Zimbabwe return to England transformed,"Twenty-two years is a long time, even in a sport that measures its games in days and its history in centuries. The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing director’s job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and Wales Cricket Board was just about to launch the world’s very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.
They have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.
“Despite all the politics, despite all the chaos that we’ve been through, cricket is now a national game,” says David Coltart, “supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races.” Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirai’s coalition government.
More than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. “I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion,” he says, “I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.”
When Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against “the death of democracy” in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. “My sadness is that Henry and Andy didn’t stay in the country,” he says, “because they remain hugely influential figures. It’s not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them.” He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, but who died in 2023. “Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers who’d been dispossessed of their land.”
For Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. “We punch above our weight.” Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.
“It was very necessary,” Coltart says. “Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable.” He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. “The land holdings were unjust,” he says, “But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasn’t violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.”
When Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. “They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, I’ve never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe,” Coltart says. “Although I’m a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, I’ve always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.”
Even now, he would be against a boycott of Afghan cricket on similar grounds. “Because if the players and the board members themselves are trying to do the right thing but are being constrained by the government, then you’ve got to support them and encourage them, not boycott them. Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.”
He is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host the Street Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. “There’s still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that we’re not spending the money that we get as best we should. I’m a politician, but I don’t think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. I’d like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.”
Still, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. “Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. It’s a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and that’s a wonderful projection of our country.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/we-are-a-passionately-multiracial-team-zimbabwe-return-to-england-transformed/,2025-05-20 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,

Bashir’s six-wicket haul seals dominant England win over Zimbabwe,"NOTTINGHAM, England – Shoaib Bashir took six wickets to return his best figures in Test cricket as England completed a dominant innings and 45-run win over Zimbabwe in a one-off match at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
Zimbabwe, following-on, were dismissed for 255 on the third day of four after England had made a commanding 565-6 declared in their first innings that featured hundreds from Zak Crawley (124), Ben Duckett (140) and Ollie Pope (171).
Off-spinner Bashir, who before arriving in Nottingham had only taken two first-class wickets this season at a hugely expensive average of 152, had Test-best figures of 6-81 from 18 overs to finish with a match haul of 9-143.
“It was nice to be back in rhythm,” player-of-the-match Bashir told the BBC after enjoying yet more Test success in Nottingham, where he took a previous Test-best 5-41 against the West Indies last year.
“At the start of the year I went on loan (from Somerset to Glamorgan) just to get some overs under my belt.”
He added: “The (England) boys and backroom staff make you feel 10 foot tall.”
Bashir is still only 21 and this was just his 16th Test, with England captain Ben Stokes saying: “The way he has asserted himself was exceptional. He knows he has the backing of the dressing room and myself… He is going from strength to strength.”
Bashir removed the aggressive Sean Williams (88) and obdurate opener Ben Curran (37) either side of lunch after the third-wicket duo had nearly batted through all of Saturday’s first session in what was Zimbabwe’s first Test in England in 22 years.
Williams was on course to regain the record for the fastest Test century by a Zimbabwe batsman he had lost to Brian Bennett earlier in this match.
But 12 minutes before lunch, he was lbw sweeping at Bashir for an 88 off just 82 balls including 16 fours.
Together with Curran he shared a century stand that revived Zimbabwe from the depths of 7-2.
Zimbabwe were roared on by a colourful band of supporters in Nottingham, with skipper Craig Ervine saying: “Our fans are like no other. A huge thank you to them.”
He added: “The first day didn’t go our way but the guys bounced back after that. Brian Bennett played an unbelievable innings.”
Curran, was dropped twice by Stokes and reprieved by a review when given out lbw on the field to Bashir.
But the son of the late Zimbabwe all-rounder Kevin and brother of England internationals Sam and Tom — gave his wicket away on 37 when he drove Bashir to Stokes at cover.
Stokes, playing his first match of the year in any form of cricket following hamstring surgery, then made another telling intervention with the ball after taking two first-innings wickets.
But he needed the help of Harry Brook, hit in the face while fielding at slip earlier in the session, to remove Wessly Madhevere for 31.
Madhevere struggled to get over the top of a sharply rising short ball from Stokes and his outside edge was brilliantly caught one-handed high above his head by a leaping Brook to the visible disbelief of the England skipper.
Bashir, who during Zimbabwe’s first-innings 265 become the youngest England bowler to take 50 Test wickets, then bowled Tafadzwa Tsiga with a superb off-break that clipped leg stump.
Sikandar Raza made a 57-ball fifty before he too succumbed to Bashir.
The match ended when Tanaka Chivanga was lbw to Bashir, with Zimbabwe then nine wickets down but with injured paceman Richard Ngarava absent hurt after he was also unable to bat in the first innings. – AFP

Zimbabwe suffer defeat in Test warm-up against County XI,"Zimbabwe will go into next week’s one-off Test against England on the back of a 138-run defeat to an unheralded Professional County Club Select XI after they failed to bat out the final day in Leicester.
Set a target of 392 after the PCC XI declared on 464 for 7 an hour into the final day, Zimbabwe slipped to 51 for 4 shortly after lunch, Hampshire’s Eddie Jack knocking over three of the top four. Nick Welch counterpunched, adding 47 with Wessly Madhevere, whose 93 had steered Zimbabwe to a first-innings total of 403, and 70 with Tafadzwa Tsiga, as the tourists reached tea five down.
But Welch couldn’t convert his innings to three figures as Essex allrounder Jamal Richards struck twice during the evening session, and although Tsiga went past 50 for the second time in the match, spinners Dan Mousley and Jafar Chohan plucked out the last three wickets to condemn Zimbabwe to defeat.
Mousley had earlier scored a second-innings 154, putting on a stand of 179 with captain Josh De Caires as the PCC XI swiftly overcame a first-innings deficit of 73. De Caires, who top-scored with 79 after electing to bat on day one, added 84 before being stumped by Tsiga off Wellington Masakadza. Mousley was later joined in reaching a hundred by Thomas Rew, as the PCC XI accelerated towards their declaration.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/zimbabwe-suffer-defeat-in-test-warm-up-against-county-xi/,2025-05-19 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,
Blast from the past: Zimbabwe are finally coming in from the cold,"Abiting wind swept across Grace Road on Thursday and though the crowd was thin, there was just enough stardust to keep the autograph hunters happy. Andrew Flintoff was perched on the pavilion balcony, while Mark Wood, trying his hand at coaching during his latest injury layoff, patrolled the boundary’s edge with a smile.
Out in the middle there were also runs for Josh de Caires, son of Mike Atherton, who compiled a fluent 79 from 93 balls on a green-tinged pitch. De Caires is a player in the modern mould charting his own course but some of the old man’s mannerisms were there to see. Mercifully, the lower back appears to be much less creaky.
But more noteworthy than the Professional County Club Select XI – a team of fresh-faced rookies led by De Caires, coached by Flintoff, and with selector Luke Wright in attendance – was the identity of their opponents. Zimbabwe have arrived for a one-off, four-day Test match against England that gets under way at Trent Bridge next Thursday, their first appearance on these shores for 22 years.
Much has changed since a series chiefly remembered for Jimmy Anderson, peroxide highlights in his hair, bursting out of the traps with five wickets on his debut at Lord’s. Tour games have largely gone the way of the Nokia 3310 (the must-have mobile phone back then, kids) and Zimbabwe have slipped from feisty overachievers, a team laced with a good deal of quality, to the unofficial second tier of Test cricket.
Indeed, after the Test next week (a warmup for England before the five-Test visit of India) Zimbabwe stick around to play South Africa in a four-day game at Arundel. That third and final game on tour is preparation for the Proteas ahead of their World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord’s next month – a competition that Zimbabwe, along with Afghanistan and Ireland, are currently excluded from.
Still, truncated though it is – a far cry from 2003, when they played two Tests and took part in an ODI tri-series along with South Africa – this tour is a welcome development. And in something of a first, the England and Wales Cricket Board is also paying the visitors a tour fee in lieu of a reciprocal trip not sitting in the future tours programme.
This apparent benevolence is in part driven by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s broadcast deal with Sky, which is predicated on delivering six Test matches every season; in the years that bring India or Australia for their usual five-match series, an early summer opponent is still needed. Ireland fulfilled this role before the 2023 Ashes, now it is Zimbabwe’s turn.
But while a schedule-filler, it would not have come about had relations between the ECB and Zimbabwe Cricket not thawed considerably in recent times, nor had the green light not come from the British government. After the dark days of Robert Mugabe’s brutal regime, and a period of considerable turmoil for cricket in Zimbabwe in which corruption was alleged to be rife, relative stability has returned to the country.
How Zimbabwe will fare in Nottingham next week is tricky to call, with their diet of Test cricket so skinny in recent years. There are just 108 caps spread among their 15-man squad (Joe Root, by comparison, has racked up 152 on his own). As the county kids cut loose to post 330 all out inside 72 overs, including half-centuries from tailenders Sebastian Morgan and Jafer Chohan, it did not augur massively well.
Equally, there was a creditable 1-1 draw in Bangladesh last month, one that featured Zimbabwe’s first away victory for seven years, and there are players of some promise in their ranks. Blessing Muzarabani, a towering 6ft 6in quick who claimed nine wickets in Sylhet, could pose some problems for England on the right surface – much as New Zealand’s similarly giant Will O’Rourke did during their last outing.
As well Muzarabani, who nicked off De Caires with a sharp delivery that climbed, there is Sikandar Raza, the Pakistani-born all-rounder who has been a world-class performer in the white-ball formats.
Experience comes from Sean Williams and skipper Craig Ervine, both 39, while Gary Ballance, though retired after a brief return to the country of his birth, is sharing local knowledge as their batting consultant.
This short tour may serve to warm up their opponents in the main but for Zimbabwe, out in the cold for more than two decades, there is sunshine breaking through.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/blast-from-the-past-zimbabwe-are-finally-coming-in-from-the-cold/,2025-05-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,sports,Ali Martin

The Zimbabwean singer who found fame in China - and obscurity at home,"Harare, Zimbabwe – It was 2017 and Jo Stak – wearing a red tuxedo jacket, a bow tie and a homburg hat – was belting out a Mandarin song.
Red and yellow lights shimmered around him as a crowd of cheering, flag-waving fans on the Chinese version of The Voice gave a standing ovation at the end of his act.
Stak’s melodious rendition of a 1992 Chinese song called The World Needs Warm Hearts was broadcast on national television.
“I was invited to perform at The Voice as a guest performer that year,” Stak recalls.
The prime-time spot reflected how well-known he’d become in China. On Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, he had about five million followers. He’d appeared on some of the country’s biggest television stations. Fans stopped him on the street to ask for a photo or just have a chat. The Zimbabwean singer was riding high.
“Being Black in China makes you stand out naturally,” he explains. “And I was a musician [so that] made me stand out more.”
The people who stopped him were often impressed that a foreigner would sing in Mandarin.
Some ‘big deal’
Today, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Joe Takawira – Stak’s real name – is an inconspicuous figure walking down a street in Budiriro 5, the working class suburb where he was born and raised. In 2019, after seven years in China, his work visa expired, and he returned home.
Sporting his signature beard, grey sweatpants, sneakers and a black T-shirt, he lights a cigarette.
He saunters past street vendors selling fresh produce and condiments, stops at a corner to chat with a friend, then goes about his day. Whenever he runs into someone he knows, he greets them with a fist bump and a toothy grin.
When he’s at home, Stak listens to instrumental music and writes songs in Mandarin.
“This is how I spend my time in Budiriro,” he says, shrugging.
It feels a long way from China and the career he enjoyed there. He has not found the same acclaim back home.
Even his neighbours had no idea about his previous life.
Clemence Kadzomba, who runs a tyre shop in Stak’s neighbourhood, had no idea who his neighbour was until some of his clients who were among the 20,000 Zimbabweans living in China recognised him.
“I couldn’t believe it,” 43-year-old Kadzomba says, grinning.
“They were so excited to see him, like he was some big deal. And yet, here he was, just hanging out with us like it was nothing.”
Unexpected journey to stardom
Stak’s musical journey has its roots in the Methodist church-run school he attended as a teenager.
He sang in his church choir, something he loved, and was part of a group of students who recorded a gospel album.
The album did well, and some of the songs have close to a million views on YouTube.
Music runs in his family, says Stak, the middle of three brothers. His older brother wrote songs at school while the youngest brother plays the piano.
After graduating, Stak enrolled to study Mandarin in China in 2012, motivated by his love for Chinese culture, which began as a boy watching Jackie Chan’s action films. He was 20 years old when he moved to Shanghai.
This came at a time when Zimbabwe was pivoting away from the West with the late leader Robert Mugabe’s “Look East” policy, adopted in response to United States and European Union sanctions after a 2002 presidential election marred by violence.
Mugabe opened Zimbabwe’s doors to Asia, leading to an influx of Chinese investment as more Zimbabweans headed to China to work or study.
By 2014, Stak was proficient in Mandarin and started posting videos of himself singing in Mandarin to Douyin. “I wanted to explore music in a different language,” he explains as he lights a cigarette and sits back in his chair on the red-floored veranda of his house.
He would sing R&B, hip-hop and pop songs in Mandarin and English and started to get booked for gigs.
“My first gig was at Yuyingtang, a music bar in Shanghai,” he recalls. He says the venue wasn’t very big but he made $1,500 – enough to pay for his food and accommodation for months.
That gig made him realise he could make money from his talent, and it marked the start of his career as a professional pop singer in China.
After that, he played at music bars, festivals, weddings and nightclubs – performing mostly in Mandarin.
Of the 37 songs he recorded, one was in the top 10 on the Chinese music streaming service Baidu Music. “It meant a lot to me,” Stak says excitedly, although it earned him only 5,000 yuan ($865).
Then in 2017, he joined the Foundation Band, a group of musicians from Africa, the US and Europe that performed Chinese and Western pop music and hip-hop at weddings and nightclubs.
As the lead vocalist, he caught the attention of Chinese television networks, leading to performances on major stations.
“I was surprised by my success in China,” Stak admits.
Life there was good. His daily routine consisted mainly of “eating, singing and drinking”.
His favourite dish was hotpot – a meal for which diners cook raw ingredients like seafood and tofu in a shared pot of broth at the table.
“Even now, when I miss it, I go to Chinese restaurants,” he says.
He’d perform at night, and during the day, he’d roam along Shanghai’s historic waterfront with its colonial-era architecture and rooftop bars.
Stak made good money. “They pay artists well – I mean 1,000 US dollars minimum for a 10-minute show.”
But he also felt accepted and at home in China, where he says the music industry welcomes foreign talent and invests in it.
Unlike many foreign artists singing in English who can struggle to break into the Chinese market, Stak had an edge – he was an African singing in Mandarin, and there were few performers like him. His ability to perform popular Chinese songs endeared him to audiences.
Coming home to anonymity
Then in 2019, Stak’s visa expired. Aged 27, he returned to a country that was in the midst of a devastating economic crisis.
His parents – his father’s an engineer, his mother’s a teacher – were coping, but across the country, people were struggling with hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages and an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.
Stak found work as a translator – and quickly discovered that Zimbabwe’s music and social media landscapes were unfamiliar to him.
He says much of his fame and success came from Chinese apps, mostly Douyin. But the apps he relied on are available only in China as Beijing restricts foreign digital platforms through its “Great Firewall”.
Without them, Stak could no longer reach his Chinese audience.
His career vanished when he left Shanghai. “I feel like a part of me remained in China,” he explains.
In Zimbabwe, nobody knew him. He started recording some music – and contemplated a switch to gospel, which is popular in the country – but he’s struggled to promote his songs. When he contacted a local radio station to play his music, he never heard back.
Stak believes that if Chinese social media were accessible to global audiences, he would still have a thriving musical career.
“That would have brought me international recognition,” he says.
For now, the translation work pays well. He currently works for a Chinese mining company, translating English or Shona into Mandarin. When he isn’t working, he tries to write music, but full-time work leaves little time to reinvent himself or find an audience for his Chinese pop.
Longing for the stage
Today, Stak is torn. He dreams of a return to China but also wants to rebuild his music career in Zimbabwe, where he hopes to marry and raise a family.
“I want to start afresh here,” he says.
“But I also miss China,” a country that was “very good and welcoming” to him, he adds.
Whether it’s in Asia or Africa, he itches to return to the stage. “I miss the spotlight,” he says.
Five years after he left China, Stak remains popular there. A couple of months ago, his Chinese boss uploaded a video of him singing in Mandarin. “[He] posted me on his WeChat status, and people were asking him about me. They were like, ‘Where is this guy?’”
Stak takes a moment and then adds, “The Chinese love me.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/04/the-zimbabwean-singer-who-found-fame-in-china-and-obscurity-at-home/,2025-04-13 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,
Styling tips for portrait shoots,"What the mirror cannot always see is often conjured up somewhat uncharmingly by the camera. The camera perceives small blemishes more strongly than is the case in reality. We’ll tell you how to apply your make-up for a professional photo shoot. You can bet that you will look perfectly fine.
SPECIAL FEATURES
Even before a photo shoot, questions about the location and the light should be clarified. Depending on the chosen light source, colors will look completely different in the photos. This is especially true for make-up. Sunlight, for example, accentuates colors, make-up mistakes, and small skin blemishes more than studio lighting. Make-up should therefore never be too strong in daylight shots. If, on the other hand, it is a studio shoot with artificial light sources, the make-up can also be stronger, as the light swallows up colors.
TIPS AND TRICKS
Good photo makeup starts with the right preparation. It is advisable not to experiment with new skincare or cosmetic products before a photo shoot. Skin irritations and minor inflammations cannot always be removed with makeup. Eyebrows should also not be plucked immediately before the shoot. A good foundation is recommended to optimally prepare the skin for the makeup. Therefore, use a light day cream tailored to your skin type.
THE COMPLEXION
An even complexion is the be-all and end-all for professional photo make-up. A well-covering foundation or even camouflage make-up is therefore highly recommended. When selecting products, make sure that the product does not have UV protection to avoid reflective spots when using flash and that the shade of the make-up matches your skin tone. You should also make sure that the make-up matches your skin needs. If you tend to have dry skin, for example, you should not use mattifying makeup as this will dry out your skin even more, which will not look good in the photos.
For a natural finish, apply the foundation using a small make-up sponge. Work the foundation into the skin with patting movements and finish by mattifying your forehead, the bridge of your nose and your chin with a translucent powder. During a shoot, these areas tend to shine more quickly than the cheeks, for example.
Photo make-up: Contouring
To give your face more contour and, therefore, more three-dimensionality for the later photos, it is now important to contour the face correctly with a contour powder. This technique is often used by professional make-up artists so that the face does not look too flat in the pictures later. First take a contour powder that is a few shades darker than your actual skin tone and a slanted brush and use it to emphasize the areas under your cheekbones, the temples and the upper forehead up to the hairline. When applying, make sure that the lines do not look too harsh. This is best achieved by blending the product in well.
Depending on your type, you can go for a light pink or a subtle peach shade on your cheeks. This will make you look very fresh and natural in the photos. To give your face even more three-dimensionality, use a highlighter. For the best result, we recommend a liquid highlighter, as this looks the most natural. Apply it with your finger to the upper cheekbones, the bridge of the nose, and the lip line. This will make these areas stand out better in the photos later on. You can see which areas you should contour for great photo make-up in our graphic.

Tips for portrait shots in black and white
If your photo shoot is a black-and-white shoot, you should be aware that these are not as flattering to the skin as color shots. In this case, the photo make-up requires stronger contours and a stronger emphasis on the lips, cheeks and eyes. It should also be noted that scars, skin problems and wrinkles are much more noticeable in black and white photos than in color photos. It is, therefore, advisable to use high-coverage make-up that does not dry out your skin.
THE EYES
Emphasize your eyes
The eyes take center stage, especially in portrait shots. Your make-up should therefore emphasize them well. The stronger the color you choose, the more defined your eyes will appear. Also, use black mascara, which you apply in several layers. You can also highlight your eyebrows with a matching eyebrow pencil.
Highlight your eye color with the right eyeshadow:
Brown eyes: You can choose all kinds of colors for brown eyes. Shades of pink and violet make the eye color stand out particularly well.
Blue eyes: For blue eyes, choose warm shades such as peach, golden brown, or champagne. These balance out the cool blue.
Green eyes: Shades of pink or brown are suitable for highlighting green eyes.
To make your eyes look expressive, you should use three different shades of color. Before you apply the colors, you can optionally use an eye primer. It serves as a primer and makes the colors look even stronger.
Then, apply the middle shade to the entire eyelid first. Apply the lightest shade to the inner corner of the eye. Use the dark shade only on the outer eyelid. Then, use a soft brush to lightly blend all the shades to create a gentle transition.

WhatsApp novelists use messaging app to write and sell books in Zimbabwe,"Harare, Zimbabwe – Sitting on a plastic chair, Kingston Dhewa stares intently at his smartphone, his thumbs jabbing furiously at the screen.
He stops briefly and looks up to attend to a customer at his outdoor fruit and vegetable stall in Budiriro 5, a busy, low-income suburb south of Zimbabwe’s capital Harare.
When the customer leaves, he grabs his phone and resumes typing in a Google Doc.
It’s around midday and the sun blazes mercilessly. Next to him, an elderly woman throws heaps of peeled and neatly cut potatoes into a gas fryer.
Loud local gospel music blasts from a solar-powered radio.
Dhewa presses on writing.
“Customers disturb my train of thought,” he tells Al Jazeera.
Dhewa has been writing for hours now and has to proofread before sending the latest chapter of his new novel to awaiting readers.
After carefully poring over the text for 20 or so minutes, he stops, highlights everything, and copies and pastes it to the WhatsApp messaging app where he sends it to his more than 1,000 followers.
Dhewa is one of the new crop of authors in Zimbabwe selling novels on WhatsApp to customers.
‘I could be writing more’
While some people write in English, Dhewa chose the local Shona language after he was inspired by other Shona authors. His books have a traditional, pre-colonial setting, and generally explore life and themes related to African rural life.
The 52-year-old first tried his hand at writing in high school and almost got published in 1992. But he could not afford the fees needed to publish traditionally.
When COVID-19 hit and authorities in the Southern African country imposed a national lockdown to stem the spread of the virus in March 2020, Dhewa found himself stuck at home. To pass the time, he read some stories that were being shared on WhatsApp – a trend that had started some years before, but really took off during the pandemic.
One group he had joined, called Read and Write, was a common group for budding writers and readers to share their work and recommendations.
“I felt that I could do a much better job [than the authors I read on that group], and wrote a story and submitted it into the group and people encouraged me to keep writing,” he tells Al Jazeera.
His first novel was well received and he earned enough money to pay rent and buy food for his family. He charged each reader $2 for the whole book.
Since then, Dhewa has written and published 43 novels via WhatsApp groups, he says – stories that range from 35 to 45 chapters long.
“I spend three to four hours writing a chapter on average. And I could be writing more if I had a laptop,” he says. For now, he is unable to afford a computer.
Authors like Dhewa begin by writing a story and releasing it on the app in serialised form, typically one chapter at a time. Readers interested in the author or genre typically join.
“I now have four groups that follow my writing on WhatsApp,” he says, as the app has a limit of 1,024 members per group and he has to create new groups to reach his readers as his popularity grows.
The first few chapters of a book are often shared for free to attract readers and build interest. Authors then promote their work on social media, including WhatsApp and Facebook, encouraging readers to join their groups and channels.
Thousands of readers
In the Budiriro 5 suburb of Harare, Clever Pada, a fan of another WhatsApp author, Pamela Ngirazi, opens and reads a chapter of her new book.
Pada runs a small tuckshop in the area where people sometimes gather. He is currently reading Ngirazi’s new book called Prior Replica, written in English.
Ngirazi, who has more than 21,000 followers on WhatsApp, is a full-time writer and very popular.
While Dhewa prefers sharing stories in Groups – that enable two-way communication, with all members able to send and respond to messages – Ngirazi uses a WhatsApp Channel.
Channels are one-way broadcast tools within the app that allow businesses and individuals to communicate with large audiences without the recipients being able to reply directly. Subscribers join the channel to receive messages, which can include text, images, videos, documents and links.
For chapters 1 to 20 of Prior Replica, Ngirazi shared it to the channel for free. But chapter 20 is her last offering.
“Prior Replica is now on sale from chapter 21 to final chapter and will be available on Boom Application that we will give you when pay for the book,” a message sent on the Channel reads.
The Boom Story app streamlines the e-publishing process, making it easier for authors and publishers to produce and distribute digital content.
Pada finds Prior Replica, which is a romance novel, quite intriguing and plans to pay to read the rest of it.
“It doesn’t seem like I have much of a choice now,” the reader says.
To access a full book, readers have to make a payment to the author via mobile money transfer services. Some authors also allow readers to buy their content by paying with mobile phone airtime.
Upon confirmation of payment, the author sends the full book to the reader, typically in PDF format, via WhatsApp. This ensures quick and direct delivery of the content.
e-Books market
Some 5 million of Zimbabwe’s 16 million people use WhatsApp. As of early this year, there are more than 2.05 million social media users aged 18 and above, representing approximately 22.8 percent of the adult population, according to a DataReportal Global Digital Insights report.
In a country where the economy has tanked and high inflation has eroded purchasing power for the majority, the high cost of data forces many Zimbabweans to use WhatsApp as a social tool.
Meanwhile for authors, the messaging app has proven to be a boon as they are able to charge directly for their services. By leveraging the app’s popularity, they are also able to engage and monetise their works.
With the rise of digital platforms and devices, more people around the world, including Zimbabweans, have access to e-books and digital reading options, such as e-readers.
But the economic crisis in the Southern African country means the majority of Zimbabweans do not have disposable incomes for such services and internet access. For instance, 250MB of data – which enables about three hours of internet use – costs $1. In comparison, salaries are not high. A teacher earns close to $300 a month while other average workers earn less.
“Of course, we can turn to Amazon, but how many Zimbabweans can buy stuff on Amazon?” Philip Chidavaenzi, a Zimbabwean author and publisher, tells Al Jazeera via a messaging service.
In 2023, the African e-books market was approximately $173.7m in revenue, with the average revenue per user at $1.47. By 2027, the number of e-Book readers on the continent is expected to reach 147.3m, with the market growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.76 percent to reach $201.3m. User penetration in the African e-books market is forecast to increase to 10.7 percent by 2027.
‘Elitist’ traditional publishing
Despite the popularity of self-publishing on WhatsApp, Chidavaenzi does not consider it a threat to traditional publishing.
“This would not be considered serious because of the possibility of breaching industry standards,” he says.
“Publishing is a very sensitive area requiring a vigorous gate-keeping process to ensure quality control. Anyone can publish anything on WhatsApp, good or bad,” Chidavaenzi adds.
He says the industry has not been spared by what he described as the “economic scourge in the country”.
Zimbabwe is in the grips of a longrunning economic crisis characterised by hyperinflation that has eroded purchasing power, foreign currency shortages and soaring unemployment.
“Publishing is generally an elitist business, and relies on a market with limited disposable incomes that compete with bread and butter … Buying books is the last option after every other commitment has been funded from the available financial resources,” Chidavaenzi says.
In his view, traditional publishing has fallen victim to several economic factors.
Even the traditional cash cow of the industry, textbook publishing, has not been spared.
“Where we could find success in textbook publishing which, all things being equal, should be a cash cow, you will realise piracy has caused havoc in the industry,” he says.
It’s a point Weaver Press founder, Irene Staunton, a veteran industry executive, underscored earlier last year in an interview with Al Jazeera.
Staunton recalled that when she was at Baobab Books, the now-defunct publisher of prize-winning literary works, if one of their titles was a set book on the school curriculum, they could sell as many as 250,000 books. To illustrate the collapse, Staunton said when author Shimmer Chinodya’s novel, Tale of Tamari, was on the school syllabus between 2018 and 2022, her company only sold 2,000 copies in four years.
The industry’s demise has been primarily driven by the widespread illegal photocopying of books, which has reached epidemic levels in the country, rendering a viable publishing industry unsustainable.
Intellectual property
For new digital publishers, copyright and intellectual property may also become a concern, as copies of their works can easily be shared around.
“Zimbabwe’s copyright laws do cover literary works published on digital platforms like WhatsApp,” Jacob Mtisi, an IT expert, told Al Jazeera. “The Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act of Zimbabwe protects the rights of authors, including those who publish their works online or through messaging apps,” Mtisi added.
He said authors can register their works with the Zimbabwe Copyright Office to formally establish their copyright and make it easier to enforce.
“Authors can include clear terms and conditions about how their works can be used, such as prohibiting unauthorised sharing or distribution,” he said.
Additionally, authors could watermark or embed “identifiable metadata in their works to track unauthorised copies”, he added.
Although the legal instruments to deal with the massive intellectual property crime in Zimbabwe exist, Chidavaenzi says that “enforcement is lax”.
The growing number of authors opting for self-publishing has prompted significant changes in Zimbabwe’s publishing industry. Emerging and lesser-known authors are more likely to use WhatsApp publishing, but some like Ngirazi have since achieved popularity and relative success.
Many of the most talented and established Zimbabwean writers are being published by international companies, primarily due to the considerable advantages they receive – such as higher advances, better royalties, and superior book promotion. International exposure also helps them build a global reputation.
But this is a far-fetched dream for most – especially newer writers who have leaned into the alternatives.
“Even if authors resort to WhatsApp, how much are you going to sell?” Chidavaenzi asks. “Can you sell enough to be able to purchase a house or residential stand? It’s impossible,” he adds.
For Dhewa, the serialised self-publishing on WhatsApp has made him a more efficient writer, he says.
It has also allowed him to share local stories that are dear to him with a wider audience. “I want the rest of the world and its people to know [and] love our culture as Africans and how we live as Black people in the rural areas,” he says.
As for his literary career, he hopes WhatsApp can take him places.
“I want to achieve literary success and recognition like that achieved by [popular Shona novelist] Patrick Chakaipa,” Dhewa says.

Archaeologists reveal musical instruments depicted in Zimbabwe’s ancient rock art,"Southern Africa has a long history of rock art research. However, research examining the relationship between rock art and music is scarce, especially in Zimbabwe.
“The subject of musical instruments in the rock art or archaeological excavations has not been prioritized. Rock art is one of the most reliable sources of music archaeology if we want to reconstruct the music and sound production of people in the past, and hence, this research focused on rock art. Most previous rock art research in Zimbabwe has focused on other aspects like themes in the rock art and regional variations across Zimbabwe,” says Dr. Kumbani.
However, in the past few years, Prof. Sarah Wurz of the University of the Witwatersrand’s research team has started addressing this research gap and identifying and documenting musical instruments in South Africa. Dr. Kumbani and Prof. Díaz-Andreu’s research is an extension of this research into Zimbabwe.
Rock art is one of the most prevalent archaeological sites in Zimbabwe, found chiefly in the country’s eastern half. Many sites have been located and identified, and more are being discovered today.
The rock art at these sites is composed of two main types: finely painted hunter-gatherer art made by the San and finger-painted farmer rock art made by incoming farmers. For this study, the researchers analyzed only the former.
Once identified, instruments were categorized into four types according to the Hornbostel-Sachs system: ideophones, membranophones, chordophones, and aerophones.
According to Dr. Kumbani, to ensure the objects they were identifying were indeed musical instruments, the postures of the instrument players were taken into account. “We were focusing on the postures of the figures to determine whether they were just holding objects or were playing instruments. For example, flute playing can be identified by someone holding a pipe with both hands, and the pipe is near the mouth, which is the source of the air that is blown into the aerophone.
“Rattle playing is usually characterized by someone holding the gourds or pear-shaped implements, and the hands are normally flexed at an angle, which may indicate the movement of hands as one shakes the idiophones.”
The researchers successfully identified rattles, a drum, trumpets, flutes, and a bullroarer. Most of these were concentrated in the Harare Province, Mashonaland East Province, and the Matobo World Heritage Cultural Landscape in Matabeleland South Province.
The researchers noted interesting differences and commonalities in the rock art instruments depicted. For one, there were regional differences. Rattles, which could be hand-held gourds or attached to shoulders and upper arms, were found in Zimbabwe.
However, leg rattles commonly depicted in South African rock art and used in “traditional” Zimbabwean dances today were absent from Zimbabwean rock art.
Dr. Kumbani says this absence of leg rattles in Zimbabwean rock art may stem from cultural differences. “This could be because of different instrument type preferences among the groups who made the art, and it shows regional variation, which may indicate that the art was made by different cultural groups.”
Similarly, musical bows, which are bows whose strings are plucked to make a sound, are absent in Zimbabwe. While depicted in other southern African rock art, these regional distinctions are mirrored in other known regional differences, such as Zimbabwe’s preference for depicting Kudu compared to South Africa’s focus on the eland.
In addition to regional trends, it was noted that many musical instrument depictions also had links to trance motifs. San shamans perform trance dances for various reasons, including healing. When depicting this act in rock art, various motifs are often used, such as therianthropes (human-animal hybrids), crouching or bending forward, having one’s hair stand erect, having elongated bodies, or having distended stomachs.
Many of these trance motifs were seen accompanying musical instruments, such as rattle images painted with therianthropes, erect hair, and a distended stomach, or a drum depicted together with dancers. These motifs indicate that drums and rattles were closely associated with ritual and ceremony, more so than with entertainment.
Meanwhile, trumpets and flutes were less clearly associated, and in both Zimbabwe and South Africa, could be depicted as being played together with trance motifs or possibly for entertainment.
The rock art sites also reveal interesting gender dynamics in the depiction of musical instrument usage. Rattles were found to be used by both male and female figures. While some shelters only had males or only females using them, at others, like Ngomakurira (Mashonaland East), both males and females were depicted using them.
Meanwhile, other instruments, such as trumpets and flutes, were only associated with males. According to Dr. Kumbani, “We are not quite certain why the pattern is like that. Ethnographically, it is known that among the San communities, women would normally sing and clap, but we do not have much information on instrument playing by women.
“There are no women playing aerophones in the rock art of Zimbabwe, and this might have deep cultural meaning where there are dos and don’ts that are gender constructed. However, we are not sure if the same applied to musical instrument playing. We are of the view that if there were no deep cultural symbolism, it was by choice that men wanted to associate themselves with playing aerophones like flutes and trumpets.”
Dr. Kumbani elaborates, saying, “In some cases, it could be by default; for example, the musical bows players that are depicted in southern Africa seem to be all men, because normally men hunted using the bows which doubled sometimes as musical instruments.”
The insights gleaned from this study of Zimbabwean rock art open up avenues for future interdisciplinary research on the connections between music, rock art, trance, and cultural identity among the San.

DUDU MANHENGA in concert: LIVE!,"Promising a trip down memory lane, the show is all about Dudu reaching out to reconnect with her
audience – this after a period out of the spotlight when, other than guesting at a few jazz events
and festivals locally, she has been immersed in ministry of the Gospel and some social
entrepreneurial endeavours that include developing an educational facility for children in need.
The playlist for the evening will include some of her best-loved music from the 6 albums to her
credit since 2003, songs which have been welcomed and celebrated not only by Zimbabwean
audiences but beyond our borders through her performances in countries including South Africa,
Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Eswatini, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Spain, Italy and Serbia.
‘Dudu Live in Concert’ is an opportunity to come and hang out, catch up with the star and, as well
as tripping down memory lane on favourite tunes, having the great opportunity of catching the
first glimpse of her new material. Half an hour into the concert which starts at 7pm, the show will
take the audience online for a sneak preview of her most recent production – the song and video of
‘Munotidisisa’, hot from the studio – and the chance to be among the first to buy it online.
Dudu has been performing professionally since 1997 at the age of 16, and by 2012 had recorded 5
albums.
She performed widely in Zimbabwe, both solo and alongside some of the nations top
artists and those from other countries, too many to be named here. Among other tours, in 2009
she toured the Southern African region under the FLAME project, as the Zimbabwean collaborator
with women artists from South Africa and Mozambique. She toured in Italy in 2011, with
performances in various cities, and again in 2012, which included a special performance for Pope
Benedict XVI, where she received the ‘Italian 25th Grand Prix Award for Social Communication’.
Dudu is considered a world-class act. Her style is influenced by great African and jazz singers, and
the dignity of her delivery is a credit to her and to her country, wherever she goes.
The Friday 11 October concert at the Zimbabwe-German Society will be an up-close-and-personal
opportunity for fans to reconnect with her, and new audiences to experience what has been
described as “an Afrojazz adventure”.

"Colonial white boys in Zimbabwe: John Eppel’s autobiography is a welcome book, but a difficult read","Nhlanhla Dube, University of Cape Town
Zimbabwean writer John Eppel’s literary career has always been defined by one peculiar trait. He publishes fictional work, in stark contrast to the majority of the country’s other white writers who have fetishised the autobiographical mode.
During the post 2000s period, white Zimbabwean narratives of crisis which focused on the land reform programme gained an international following.
Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle was fought primarily over the land question. In colonial Rhodesia, racist apportionment of fertile land meant that the black majority was removed from productive farmland. The land reform programme sought to correct this historical injustice.
Eppel’s focus on novels, poetry and short stories explains why he is rarely ever mentioned with autobiographical writers such as Peter Godwin, Alexandra Fuller, Judith Todd and Douglas Rogers.
His shift to the autobiographical mode with A Colonial Boy: Sketches of My Life Before Zimbabwean Independence, 1950-1980 from indie publisher Pigeon Books, invites those of us who are scholars of his work to re-interrogate his writing.
The literary sketch
In A Colonial Boy, Eppel takes the reader through his early days in South Africa and Swaziland and his arrival in Southern Rhodesia with his family. In the prologue, he sets up the context:
For this collection I wanted to write about the comic side of my life as a Rhodesian, and the sketch, as a literary genre, seemed more appropriate than a conventional autobiography. Although the sketch has a pedigree going back to the 16th century, my interest in it was sparked by Charles Dickens’ first published book Sketches by ‘Boz’.
Eppel is an English teacher and literary critic. Literary analysis even informs some of his fictional characters. One gets the sense that he intends to make A Colonial Boy Dickensian in gravity, scope and quality.
The literary sketch is an uncommon mode. This complicates our understanding of how Eppel tries to deliver his life’s story. Sketches are meant to be brief chronicles of particular events which are not usually connected to a larger story. It’s doubtful that the linear timeline of a human life can be accurately represented through the literary sketch.
The randomness of the sketch as a stylistic method does not adhere well to the classical image of the autobiographer as a “self-interested individual intent on assessing the status of the soul”. This becomes apparent when Eppel moves quickly from sketch to sketch without giving full details and reflection on the incidents being invoked.
Even when writing this book review, it is difficult to give you, the reader, an accurate idea of what Eppel has to say, on reflection, about his earlier years. The scenes (or sketches) do not demonstrate a unity of purpose. Rather than Eppel saying “this is what happened in my life and I would like you to know about it so that you get to know me better”, the reader gets “this is what happened on a random day in a particular year in colonial Rhodesia, so make of it what you will”. To be fair, Eppel does warn the reader in advance:
What you will find in these pages is a series of anecdotes about me from toddlerhood to my early thirties.
Fine. But what is the point of this randomness?
My reading is that it’s an attempt to introduce narrative detachment – in the same way as an author would create distance between themself and their character. The problem is, this is not a novel. There should not be a border between the narrator and the protagonist in self life writing.
White men and war
Of course, Eppel might have good reason for wanting to create narrative detachment. Other white Zimbabwean writers have seen their autobiographical writings affect their daily lives. David Coltart’s memoirs, for example, generated much discussion over his role in the Rhodesian security forces. He was one of the many white men required to undergo compulsory service by the white minority government.
In his sketches, Eppel gives very brief details about his time serving in the armed forces. Ever the renegade with a problem with authority, he describes his time in the Rhodesian army as “eight weeks of institutionalised hell”. The Chimurenga war was fought by black nationalists in order to bring about democracy and black majority rule. Eppel essentially acknowledges that morally, he was on the wrong side of that war.
Eppel is also aware of how the literary establishment has labelled his work as Rhodesian racist rhetoric. This is a charge Eppel scholars like myself have tried to fight. Regardless, Eppel wisely refuses to elaborate on his operational activities in the war:
I was involved in one contact, near a post on the Mozambique border called Vila Salazar. I have recorded this contact in poetry (confessional) and in prose (satirical), but there is no place for it on these pages.
The political considerations Eppel had in mind when writing these sketches prevent the reader from gaining a non-fictional account of his wartime experience.
Autobiographies can come in the form of an apologia. This is often a memoir written by politicians at the end of their careers to defend certain policy positions they took. By avoiding the military issue, Eppel wisely moves away from turning these sketches into an apologia.
A welcome book but a difficult read
A Colonial Boy is a welcome book for Eppel scholars such as myself. It does a lot to connect the man to his fiction. However, I struggle to see its relevance to the general readership.
Avid readers of fast paced white Zimbabwean autobiographies will likely lament the lack of action in these sketches. They will probably abhor the sketch form itself. There are no clear villains here. The thematic identifiers that define white Zimbabwean autobiography are absent. There are no enduring images of black Zimbabwean suffering, no corruption, no racial violence, no farms taken, and no white people beaten up.
Perhaps though, this is the point Eppel is trying to make. A life well lived should not have to be a spectacle.

"Zimbabwean Filmmaker, Activist Chosen for Spendlove Prize","Tsitsi Dangarembga, a renowned Zimbabwean filmmaker, novelist and cultural activist, was selected as the 16th recipient of the Alice and Clifford Spendlove Prize in Social Justice, Diplomacy and Tolerance .
Tsitsi Dangarembga is best known for her critically acclaimed 1988 debut novel, “Nervous Conditions.” The first book by a Black Zimbabwean woman to be published in English, it won the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize and is celebrated for its incisive portrayal of colonialism, gender and identity in postcolonial Africa.
The novel is part of a trilogy, followed by “The Book of Not” (2006) and “This Mournable Body” (2018). The latter made a short list for the Booker Prize.
Dangarembga also is an accomplished filmmaker, with her work often focusing on African women’s experiences. She founded the International Images Film Festival for Women in Zimbabwe, advocating for more representation of women in African cinema. She also founded the Institute of Creative Arts for Progress in Africa (ICAPA), which aims to develop filmmakers who can boost Africa’s presence in the growing global film economy.
The Spendlove Prize is made possible by a generous gift from Sherrie Spendlove, a Merced native. It was founded in 2005 in honor of her parents, Alice and Clifford Spendlove, who were lifelong professionals dedicated to the lives of citizens, youth and students of the Merced region.
Every year, the Spendlove Prize honors an individual who can serve as a role model and inspirational figure for students, faculty and the community surrounding UC Merced. The prize has an annual value of $15,000.
“We are extremely pleased to add the contributions of this exciting artist-activist to the Spendlove Prize,” said Spendlove and her son, Micah Gallo. “This is the first prolific filmmaker we have had as a recipient, and we look forward to seeing more of her work in the future.”
A dedicated activist, Dangarembga has spoken out against corruption and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, notably being arrested in 2020 for protesting against political repression. Her commitment to social justice, both through art and activism, has made her a prominent voice in Zimbabwe and internationally.
Dangarembga studied psychology at the University of Zimbabwe and earned a master’s degree in directing at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin. She is currently working on fiction and non-fiction literary projects. She has a slate of fiction films in development through ICAPA.
“Tsitsi Dangarembga’s remarkable achievements in advancing justice and tolerance exemplify the ideals of the Spendlove Prize,” said Leo Arrioloa, dean of UC Merced’s School of Humanities, Social Sciences and Arts. “Her profound contributions to the arts and activism have not only amplified the voices of African women but have also illuminated the pressing issues of human rights on the global stage.”
The public is invited to an event honoring Dangarembga on Nov. 13 at UC Merced’s Lakireddy Grand Ballroom. An award ceremony is scheduled for 5 p.m. and a reception at 6 p.m. Dangarembga will give a talk titled “Ubuntu 2.0: Thoughts on a More Equal World from an Old African Institution.”
Past recipients of the prize include the Dalai Lama, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú Tum, psychology professor and activist Faye Crosby, and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/10/zimbabwean-filmmaker-activist-chosen-for-spendlove-prize/,2024-10-22 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,

Harare Open Mic returns,"The open mic, a platform that provides space for artists to experiment with the stage, has been running for the past five years and is becoming a popular space especially for young artists who are trying to grow their brand, gain confidence with the stage as well as network with other artists from different genres.
The organiser of the open mic, Batsirai Chigama says, “I remember a time when this kind of space was offered to us by the Book Cafe. It was a space filled with innumerable opportunities for networking, collaboration and finding one’s feet and voice as a young artist. I feel it is a critical space that offers development of a artist before they hit the big stages. It thrills me to be able to open up possibilities for growth and nurture talent that will one day be big and gracing other different platforms.”
This year, Harare Open Mic has once again partnered with The Garden, One Billion Rising and over thirty two artists who are coming through to perform on the day. Art forms represented include music, comedy, poetry, dance and theatre.
Billed to perform are young and promising poets such as Tadana Nakai, Yvonne Matanhire. These will be supported by more seasoned poets such as Shingirai Manyengavana, Takudzwa Goniwa, Khadijah Finesse, Tamika, Momo Size and Tawanda Vombo.
Young and rising mbira player Aripheleng Kwela is expected to thrill the audience with her powerful voice along side hip-hop star D-Blok, AneUnhu Gwatidzo, Tendai Mhlanga, Nicole Livet, The Breeze and many more young voices coming through to perform at Harare Open Mic for the first time.
Chigama says that the registration was oversubscribed and many others who had wanted to perform could not be accommodated in the March edition. “It is encouraging to see the hunger in the young artists to perform and I hope resources permitting I can be able to organise more regular sessions so that more artists can benefit from this initiative.”
“Harare Open Mic offers an easy laid back family outing. If you have a child, friend or just someone you know who may benefit from being in this space, bring them along, they may learn a thing or two and be inspired to explore more of their talent,” said Chigama

Mbare Art Space: a colonial beer hall in Zimbabwe has become a vibrant arts centre,"In southern Africa townships were built as segregated urban zones for black people. They were created under colonial and white minority rule policies that controlled movement, confined opportunity, and kept people apart.
I grew up in a different historic black township in Zimbabwe, but Mbare was the first of its kind. It holds a unique place in the nation’s imagination.
Mbare was originally named Harare. But in 1982 that name was reassigned to the capital city that houses it. In its storied past, it was once the heartbeat of black urban life. At its centre is Rufaro Stadium, where Bob Marley and the Wailers famously performed at Zimbabwe’s independence celebrations.
The township was a hub of cultural energy, sports, and political activism, and the community beer hall served as a vital gathering point. Today, many of these beer halls stand derelict.
These once-thriving communal spaces reflect a broader neglect of civic infrastructure in post-independence Zimbabwe. Yet out of these ruins, new life is taking shape.
One of the most influential figures in Zimbabwe’s artist-run spaces movement, Moffat Takadiwa, has transformed one of these former beer halls into the Mbare Art Space. The dynamic arts hub reclaims the building’s original spirit of gathering, creativity and public engagement.
Operating under a long lease from the Harare City Council, this nonprofit initiative is part of a wider urban renewal and adaptive reuse project aimed at reimagining the city’s cultural infrastructure.
My ongoing work in archival research includes mapping and visiting historical and cultural spaces like this. Here Takadiwa saw the potential for not just studios and an exhibition venue, but also for dialogue and community regeneration.
Transforming spaces
Beer halls were established by British colonial authorities in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) as part of a strategy of social control over the African urban population. They were designed to regulate leisure, restrict political organising and generate revenue through the sale of alcohol. By centralising drinking in state-run facilities, colonial administrators aimed to monitor and contain African social life while profiting from it.
Situated in a repurposed colonial-era beer garden, Mbare Art Space turns a former site of segregation into a vibrant centre of artistic and communal revival. It redefines a legacy of constraint and control as one of creative freedom and empowerment. The place is now an artists’ haven with studios, office space, an exhibition hall and a digital hub.
Takadiwa’s vision is informed by global precedents, notably inspired by US artist Theaster Gates, whose work includes the transformation of a derelict bank on Chicago’s South Side. It became the Stony Island Arts Bank – a hybrid space for art, archives and community engagement.
Takadiwa opened Mbare Art Space in 2019 with a vision to support emerging artists through mentorship and access to resources. True to his artistic philosophy – resurrecting abandoned, often overlooked materials suffering the effects of urban decay – he revitalised a neglected site. Most of the artists working from this space follow his lead, upcycling and recycling found materials into compelling visual forms that speak to both history and possibility.
When I arrive, Takadiwa is on his way out, but offers me a quick tour of his studio, where works in progress for his upcoming participation in the São Paulo Biennale are taking shape.
Known for his lush, densely layered sculptures and tapestry-like works made from found objects – computer keyboards, bottle tops, toothbrushes, and toothpaste tubes – Takadiwa has garnered international acclaim. His works are collected by US rapper Jay-Z and major institutions like the Centre National d’Art Plastique in Paris, the European Parliament’s art collection in Brussels, and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare.
Collaboration
What Takadiwa is building is not just an arts centre – it’s a new model space rooted in history and responsive to the present. The site itself becomes an ongoing installation, activated by the artists, curators and community members who inhabit it.
Tafadzwa Chimbumu, the operations manager, takes over the tour, guiding me through the rest of the precinct. The site retains the bones of its beer hall architecture, but it bursts with new life. Colourful murals adorn the walls. Tents draped over smaller buildings animate the exposed brickwork.
Plans are underway to establish a library here, a resource where researchers and artists can engage with Zimbabwe’s under-documented art history. Much of this history is scattered across archives and unpublished dissertations, rather than in widely available books. The aim is to bring these materials together and make them more accessible to the public.
Mbare Art Space is also becoming an exciting hub for collaboration and education. Community workshops, for example, are led by resident artists. Local schools take part in art education initiatives. Through community outreach and educational programming, the centre is extending its impact beyond its immediate geography.
As it looks to the future, Mbare Art Space is focused on expanding its artist-in-residence programme, inviting both local and international artists to immerse themselves in the context of Mbare and Zimbabwe.
Ultimately, what the space offers is something intangible – a feeling, a memory, a vision of what is possible when history and imagination meet in a shared place.

Women behind the lens: ‘This is how I see Zimbabwe - thriving in the face of challenges’,"I took this image, titled Lotus, of Rosebud Tsikira – a model, award-winning makeup artist and colleague – in a recreational park in Harare, Zimbabwe. I chose the location because the lotus flower emerges here from murky waters and, despite difficult living conditions, produces beautiful blooms.
This is how I view Zimbabwe and our people because we are inherently strong and resourceful. We have a deep well of creativity and perseverance that allows us to thrive even in the face of challenges.
Rosebud’s spirit, like the lotus, reflects resilience and liberation. Her boldness is reflected in the way she commands attention from the camera. She is holding an African staff which is symbolic of authority, dominance and presence.
I created Rosebud’s African-Victorian dress with my designer, blending Victorian style with African wax print. The pattern on the fabric mirrors the shape of the Lotus plants.
I use African prints in every shoot. They show how cultures and communities connect: people share them as gifts, buy them as souvenirs, or wear them while travelling. My photography is about making connections too – between dreams and reality, and between the past, present, and future. Photography’s magic is capturing fleeting moments and making them last for ever.
Lotus is part of a larger project entitled Birds of a Paradise, representing everyday people from contemporary life in Zimbabwe – and new beginnings. This image captures the transformative power of new beginnings – the lotus that started off as a seed and is now in full bloom; the light reflecting on the lotus leaves; Rosebud standing strong – and signifies hope on the horizon for us Zimbabweans.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/06/women-behind-the-lens-this-is-how-i-see-zimbabwe-thriving-in-the-face-of-challenges/,2024-04-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,
Walking Dead actor Danai Gurira inspires African playwrights with Zimbabwe workshops,"A group of upcoming playwrights is gathering in the Zimbabwean capital Harare this week for an 11-day event organised by celebrated American-Zimbabwean actor Danai Gurira as part of her commitment to nurturing a new generation of dramatic artists in southern Africa.
The Almasi African Playwrights conference is hosted by Almasi Collaborative Arts, the organisation Gurira co-founded in 2011, and offers writers a chance to develop their work with directors and actors. Running from 11 December at Harare’s Reps theatre, it is part of Almasi’s aim to promote and celebrate African storytelling. Gurira is expected to join the group.
Best known for her award-winning roles in the Walking Dead series and Black Panther movies, Gurira is also a dramatist. Her plays include Eclipsed, the first play to premiere on Broadway with an all female and black cast and creative team.
“What I kept experiencing was coming home from the US [to Zimbabwe] and finding people were not getting trained in this field,” Gurira said. “They were telling me they wrote a play in three days! Playmaking is hard, there is no sustainable piece of writing that can be completed in three days. I wanted to expose the Zimbabwean artist to process, so they could develop their talent to its utmost potential. That is the only way we create work that is globally recognised. It is the only way we create work that tells our stories in a way that is undeniable and universal.”
More than 500 African artists have participated in workshops devised by Gurira and Tawenga over the past 11 years and attended by guest actors and other industry figures from the US, including playwright Alice Tuan; Walking Dead producer and writer Matt Negrette; costume designer Clint Ramos and director Lucie Tiberghien, who co-directed Almasi’s most recent play, Family Riots with Almasi alumnus Makomborero Theresa Muchemwa.
The African Playwrights conference is Almasi’s flagship event and has led to the development of 20 plays since it started in 2015. More than 60 playwrights, actors, producers and directors are expected to attend this year.
“There is nothing else like it on this scale – as far as I know. It’s heaven for playwrights”, said Gideon Jeph Wabvuta, a playwright and programme coordinator at Almasi.
He said the event was part of a “growing excitement around theatre in Zimbabwe”, boosted this year by the launch of an Outstanding Playwright category in the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe awards. “This kind of recognition is such a big deal,” he added.
The conference follows Almasi’s staging of Family Riots last month at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare, the organisation’s first full production in more than 10 years. Written by Wabvuta, the play tells the story of an upwardly mobile family in Mbare, Zimbabwe’s oldest township, during the 1998 food riots.
“It is about family and it is about class,” said Wabvuta. “When I started writing the play [in 2013], the people were based on my parents. But I kept writing for so long that the people in the play became me and my wife!”
Wabvuta said the gallery was chosen as a venue in part because he wanted to offer a different experience to attract people who might not usually go to the theatre. “One couple came because their son, a standup comedian, recommended it. They had never been to the theatre before.”
Gurira said the choice of venue also reflected Almasi’s mission. “I love the idea of collaborating with another form of African art. We are called Almasi Collaborative Arts and the idea of a collaboration like this felt exciting and different for us. Let’s merge the visual arts with installation art, and musical art with theatre art,” she added.
Wabvuta, who joined Almasi’s programme in its first year and attended the University of Southern California MFA dramatic writing programme, said that while he was optimistic about the new crop of writers, funding was a significant barrier to making a living from theatre. His role at Almasi gives him the financial stability to continue his work as a playwright. Others have not been as lucky.
Many of the 500 or so artists Almasi has trained have left the profession because of poor pay. “Our industry struggles to keep its people,” said Wabvuta. “It’s a money issue”, adding that the lead actor in Family Riots, Michael Kudakwashe, gave up acting to pursue a full-time job but agreed to take on the role for this production.
Associate director at Almasi Zaza Muchemwa believes that offering professional training will help create a more dynamic and robust dramatic arts scene in Zimbabwe.
“I was always keenly aware of what this [dramatic arts] space is and what it could be. When Almasi began, there weren’t a lot of organisations or tertiary institutions that were training creatives.”
Gurira added that seeing young playwrights grow in confidence was one of the most rewarding parts of her role at Almasi. “Seeing them get to explore their craft and impress even themselves. That means everything. Those artists will never be the same. Their work has transformed, and so have they. That has been very gratifying.”
She added that Almasi planned to work more with local partners such as businesses and embassies with the aim of “spearheading a new age in the Zimbabwe entertainment industry”.
“As our name connotes, we seek to collaborate. Our goal lies in what we seek to build, like the name ‘Zimbabwe’ itself, we seek to build a house of stone that lasts.”",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2024/12/walking-dead-actor-danai-gurira-inspires-african-playwrights-with-zimbabwe-workshops/,2024-12-12 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,arts,
"Drought imperils Zimbabwe’s ancient rock art, spurring efforts to preserve and date it","THE MATOBO HILLS IN ZIMBABWE—Sketched onto the walls of a granite outcropping in the hills of southern Zimbabwe, tall, rust-red human figures gather around groups of antelopes and giraffes. The painting, along with more than 3000 others in the area, portrays animals spiritually important to the nomadic San people who created them sometime between 2000 and 13,000 years ago. This pictorial record of San culture in the Matobo Hills is one of Africa’s highest concentrations of rock art; it was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003.
But the paintings are under threat from vandalism as well as erosion. Now, a nonprofit group near the hills is working with local people to document and raise awareness of the rock art before it disappears. Since July, the Amagugu International Heritage Centre (AIHC), based in the village of Whitewater near the southern city of Bulawayo, has been collaborating with the U.S. embassy in Zimbabwe and the country’s national museum to record local stories about the art, identify new sites, and develop a catalog of artworks that can be analyzed by experts even if the original paintings fade. The team plans to release a final catalog and a documentary about the project in January 2025.
Preserving the art is essential to understanding the ancient societies that created it, said Ancila Nhamo, a professor of archaeology at the University of Zimbabwe working on the project. “Art is a product of the mind and the culture, which is an intangible thing,” she said. “But when you get the art, you can get into the minds of these people and really see what the world was like at that time.”
This year, Zimbabwe has undergone one of the worst droughts in living memory, with maximum temperatures 2°C to 5°C above normal. Hot, dry weather boosts the risk of wildfires and kills vegetation, increasing soil erosion and making rock art sites more prone to flooding during the rainy season, as researchers in nearby Namibia have found.
The paintings are also vulnerable to vandalism, such as graffiti, and damage from fires, which are sometimes set by locals unaware of the paintings’ importance. Unlike previous efforts led by outsiders, this project aims to inspire a sense of ownership over and responsibility for the sites among local people. “The [local residents] are the people who should play a part in preserving, documenting, and protecting this cultural heritage,” said Allington Ndlovu, a program manager at AIHC.
The people in the area today are mostly farmers of the Ndebele ethnic group, whose ancestors migrated from the north in several waves starting about 4000 years ago. The ancient Ndebele interacted with the nomadic San, whose descendants still live in some parts of Zimbabwe and in South Africa. Today, San people feel the rock art can help them understand their heritage, said Davy Ndlovu, director of the Tsoro-o-tso San Development Trust, a Zimbabwean nongovernment organization that advocates for the rights of the Indigenous group. “The cultural heritage of the San is critically endangered and there is very little awareness around the issue,” Ndlovu said. “Projects like this can assist the San to get their voices heard … and assist coming generations to understand the heritage of Zimbabwe.”
The project organizers worked with local leaders to train 35 women from seven villages in drawing and painting techniques. The local artists then replicated 35 artworks using pencils, brushes, and paint, creating a visual record now displayed in a community gallery. Fourteen of the largest and clearest rock paintings were reproduced on canvas and granite slates, to be displayed in the country’s national gallery.
Meanwhile, a joint French-Zimbabwean research project called MATOBART is working to date rock art in the Matobo Hills. The paint is made of inorganic material so it can’t be radiocarbon dated, said project leader Camille Bourdier of the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès. Instead, she and other researchers set out to date stone tools, including palettes likely used to create the paintings, and flakes of paint that fell to the ground. They hope to estimate minimum ages by directly dating the sediment around these artifacts.
Preliminary findings confirm earlier estimates made by archaeologists in the 1980s, who suggested the paintings were created starting about 13,000 years ago. More precise dating will allow researchers to more accurately interpret the art, Nhamo said. For instance, rock art in Zimbabwe mainly depicts kudu antelopes, she says, whereas similar San sites in nearby South Africa focus on another antelope, the eland. Nhamo would like to know whether San people painted different animals over time, or distinct San groups valued particular animals as markers of community identity, a way to distinguish themselves from their neighbors.
Other interpretations focus on the spiritual, rather than social, importance of the animals, said Sam Challis, who heads the Rock Art Research Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand. San people started to paint “richly embellished” eland at sites in the Drakensberg Mountains during a period of cooler climate that began around 1500 B.C.E., when the animals—previously a staple food source—were becoming more scarce, as Challis and anthropologist Brian Stewart of the University of Michigan wrote in a 2023 paper. They argue that by painting the eland, the San were attempting to harness the antelope’s spiritual powers to summon more of them to appear during a time of scarcity.
The artworks now being documented in the Matobo Hills, including scenes of antelopes, elephants, and gnus surrounded by humans walking with bows and arrows and dancing or sitting, could yield similar insights for future researchers, Bourdier said. “These [San] hunter-gatherers have been living this way for tens of thousands of years. … It has proven to be a very sustainable way of living,” she said. “Unraveling these ways of living within the world could give us some clues of the type of behaviors or relationships we could go back to.”

Tracking Donald Trump's indictments,"Donald Trump's criminal cases, in one place
President-elect Donald Trump will face no legal penalties for his conviction in the hush money case. Judge Juan Merchan upheld Trump’s conviction in the case on January 3, 2025, rejecting the president-elect’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his reelection in November. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.
Previously, special counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25 that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump. While Smith is dropping his prosecution of Trump, he said that prosecutors would keep alive their case against two of his employees in the classified documents case.
Since Trump’s reelection, Smith had been in talks with Justice Department leadership about how to end both cases. Trump has said he would fire Smith once he retook the office, shattering previous norms around special counsel investigations.
On September 12, some charges in the Fulton County case were thrown out by the judge.

Summary
Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. On May 30, 2024 he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree by 12 jurors. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further, they alleged he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including the $130,000 payment. Trump pleaded not guilty.
On November 19, 2024, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told Judge Juan Merchan it would agree to delay Trump’s sentencing, which had been set for November 26, to allow time for the anticipated litigation around the president-elect’s expected motion to dismiss the case. On November 22, Merchan indefinitely postponed the sentencing and granted Trump’s request to file a motion to dismiss the case. On January 3, 2025, Merchan rejected Trump's effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his reelection in November and upheld the conviction. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.

Summary
Special counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25, 2024, that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.
Smith had filed a superseding indictment on August 27 in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped. In the reworked indictment, prosecutors argue several times that Trump didn't have any constitutionally assigned presidential duties regarding the post-election transition of power. In one instance, prosecutors pointed to the Electoral College certification proceedings that took place during a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021. The criminal charges in part accuse Trump of illegally obstructing the certification proceeding. The Trump campaign has previously denied the allegations and Trump pleaded not guilty to all four counts.
On February 6, 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. On July 1, the Supreme Court rejected that decision, ruling that Trump can claim limited immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken in office — likely further delaying a trial in the case.
On Oct. 2, 2024, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., released a 165-page filing from Smith in which the special counsel argues that Trump acted to overturn the election in his private capacity as a candidate, rather than in his official capacity as a president. The document, which offers the fullest account of the special counsel's evidence, lays out the prosecution's case for a trial judge in a way that they believe would overcome the immunity protections around the presidency that the Supreme Court outlined.
The initial charging documents repeatedly reference six co-conspirators, but as is common practice, their identities were withheld because they have not been charged with any crimes. However, based on quotes in the indictment and other context, CNN can identify five of the six co-conspirators below.
Charges
Key evidence
A January 2, 2021, phone call between then-President Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where Trump “lied” in an attempt “to induce him” to overturn the election and find the exact number of votes to flip his defeat in Georgia, prosecutors said in the indictment.
Key people
People involved
Rudy Giuliani
A former Trump lawyer and former mayor of New York City. The indictment quotes from a voicemail that Co-Conspirator 1 left “for a United States Senator” on January 6, 2021, which match quotes from Giuliani’s call intended for GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, as reported by CNN and other outlets. Ted Goodman, a political adviser to Giuliani, said in a statement that “every fact Mayor Rudy Giuliani possesses about this case establishes the good faith basis President Donald Trump had for the actions he took.”
John Eastman
A former Trump lawyer. The indictment says Co-Conspirator 2 “circulated a two-page memorandum” with a plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election. Quotes from the memo match a two-page document that Eastman wrote, as reported and published by CNN. Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, said the indictment “relies on a misleading presentation of the record,” and that his client would decline a plea deal if offered one.
Sidney Powell
A former Trump lawyer. The indictment says Co-Conspirator 3 “filed a lawsuit against the Governor of Georgia” on November 25, 2020, alleging “massive election fraud,” which match the federal lawsuit that Powell filed against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. An attorney for Powell declined to comment.
Jeffrey Clark
A former Justice Department official. The indictment quotes an email that a top Justice Department official sent to Clark, rebutting Clark’s attempts to use the department to overturn the election as previously identified in a Senate report about how Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department in 2020. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Clark.
Kenneth Chesebro
A pro-Trump lawyer. The indictment references an “email memorandum” that Co-Conspirator 5 “sent” to Co-Conspirator 1 on December 13, 2020, about the fake electors plot. The email matches an email that Chesebro sent to Giuliani, according to a copy made public by the House select committee that investigated January 6. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Chesebro.
Co-Conspirator 6
The indictment says they are “a political consultant who helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.” The indictment also further ties this person to the fake elector slate in Pennsylvania.

Summary
An Atlanta-based grand jury on August 14, 2023, indicted Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former president’s 2020 electoral defeat. Four people have pleaded guilty.
The historic indictment is the fourth criminal case that Trump is facing. The charges, brought in a sweeping investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, cover some of the most overt efforts by the former president and his allies to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. Unlike the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, Willis’ case will be insulated if Trump is reelected in 2024; he will not be able to pardon himself or his allies of any state law convictions, nor will he be able to order the state-level prosecutors to withdraw the charges. Trump pleaded not guilty via court filing, waiving an in-court appearance as allowed by Georgia law.
On March 13, 2024, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee dismissed six of the 41 counts from the indictment, including three that applied to Trump. The partial dismissal does not mean that the entire indictment has been dismissed. McAfee’s partial dismissal left most of the sprawling racketeering indictment intact.
On June 5, a Georgia appeals court indefinitely paused the case for Trump and some co-defendants until a panel of judges rules on whether Willis should be disqualified.
On September 12, some of the charges were thrown out by the judge.

Key evidence
The indictment document includes Trump’s notorious phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger when he asked Raffensperger to “find” the votes he needed to win the state, the fake elector scheme and a September 2021 letter he sent to Raffensperger again urging him to decertify the state’s 2020 vote.
CNN has previously reported that surveillance video, text messages and other communications unearthed during a civil case provided essential evidence for prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

ANC Urged To Expel Geza Over Alleged Zimbabwe Destabilisation Plot,"According to The NewsHawks, Nyekorach-Matsanga has long been known as a staunch ZANU-PF supporter and public relations operative, having previously worked as a propagandist for Zimbabwe’s ruling party during the late President Robert Mugabe’s tenure.
In a letter dated 18 May and addressed to ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula, Nyekorach-Matsanga urged the South African government to expel Geza.
He accused Geza of using South African territory as a base to launch attacks against Zimbabwe’s leadership, claiming that such activities undermine regional peace and security in contravention of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), African Union (AU), and United Nations (UN) treaties and protocols.
Titled “Urgent Legal and Diplomatic Concerns Regarding Activities of one Bombshell Geza and Associated Groups Operating from South African Soil,” the letter alleges that Geza is at the centre of a wider network of political groups, activists, NGOs, and digital media platforms.
This network, it claims, is orchestrating a coordinated “campaign of destabilisation” targeting President Emmerson Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF, and the Zimbabwean government. Part of the letter reads:
We write oo behalf of the Pan African Forum Limited & Associates, a continental advocacy and legal policy platform, to express our grave concern regarding the continued use of South Africa soil, particularly under the ANC-led government, as a staging ground for regime change activities targeting the sovereign Republic of Zimbabwe.
We have gathered credible intelligence and evidence indicating that one Bombshell Geza and a network of foreign-sponsored actors are actively operating from South Africa, utilising non-governmental organisations, digital media platforms, and political networks to coordinate a destabilisation campaign against the ruling party in Zimbabwe, ZANU PF, and President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration.
These operations, which include digital disinformation warfare and mobilisation of protest strategies, constitute a direct violation of regional and international law. This is where our specialty is.
Our legal and diplomatic concerns in the conduct of these actors that contravene Article 4(c) of the SADC Treaty, which upholds non-interference in the internal affairs of member states.
Their actions further breach the African Union Constitutive Act1, Articles 3(b) and (g), on sovereign respect and condemnation of unconstitutional changes of government.
South Africa’s inaction may amount to a violation of its obligations under the United Nations Charter, Article 2(4), as well as its own domestic legal instruments, including the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorism Act.
Nyekorach-Matsanga urged South Africa and the ANC to uphold Pan-African solidarity and respect for national sovereignty. He said:
We request ANC to co-operate with the Government of Zimbabwe and SADC regional mechanisms to ensure South African territory is not used for the destabilisation of a fellow member state.We however, state here that we are not acting on the instructions of Zimbabwe Government but we the watch tower of Africa.
Just like South Africa went to (International Court of Justice) ICJ for Human Rights abuses in Gaza by Israel, we have acted on behalf of better Africa.
We must add that failure to act on this matter risks eroding the integrity of SADC, undermining the credibility of the ANC as a Pan-African liberation movement, and encouraging further external manipulation of African political systems.
We are prepared to initiate a formal submission to the African Union Peace and Security Council and the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation if this matter is not addressed expeditiously.
Geza, a war veteran and member of ZANU PF’s Central Committee, is wanted by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) on a range of criminal charges.
These include the alleged theft of three motor vehicles, which were reportedly taken and disposed of without the owner’s consent.
He is also accused of undermining the authority of, or insulting, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, an offence under Zimbabwe’s Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, as well as inciting public violence, particularly in connection with his calls for a national shutdown in protest against the country’s worsening economic conditions.
Geza has been an outspoken critic of Mnangagwa’s administration, accusing it of corruption and gross economic mismanagement.

ED Term Extension: Zimbabweans Must Unite in Defence of the Constitution,"The Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (The Coalition) urges progressive Zimbabweans to remain vigilant in light of the concerted efforts by the ZANU-PF regime and some self-serving politicians to illegally extend President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s term beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms without a referendum.
We are fully aware of a document drafted by the ZANU PF legal Committee, which convened last month with the specific aim of formulating proposals to implement the ambitious 2030 agenda while intentionally circumventing the constitutional requirement for a national referendum.
The three proposals outlined within this document are not only undemocratic but represent a direct affront to the principles of fair governance. Consequently, it is imperative that as citizens we mount a robust resistance against these moves through a multifaceted approach that includes legal challenges, strategic engagement within parliament especially with progressive members from both the opposition and ruling party benches, and organized mass action across communities.
Additionally, we note that the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, was also assigned the task of providing a legal opinion on the viability of achieving the 2030 agenda without resorting to a referendum, a process critical to ensuring democratic legitimacy.
Furthermore, we have become aware of a Memorandum presented to Cabinet by Ziyambi Ziyambi, the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, proposing to amend the constitution with the explicit goal of extending the terms of office for the president, parliamentary representatives, and local council officials.
This amendment, to be pushed through by the ZANU PF caucus and in connivance with a section of compromised opposition legislators led by Sengezo Tshabangu, seeks to postpone upcoming elections, shifting the timeline from 2028 to 2030, thereby undermining the democratic process. This self-serving agenda reflects a total disregard for the will of the people of Zimbabwe as reflected in the 2013 constitution that was unanimously voted for by the people of Zimbabwe.
The 2013 constitution was supposed to mark a shift from an authoritarian to a more democratic society and this power grab (under the guise of Vision 2030) is an affront to the Constitution of Zimbabwe and the democratic aspirations of the Zimbabwean people. Any such amendment will have to go through a referendum where the people of Zimbabwe will participate.
It is regrettable that despite the 2013 Constitution being lauded as progressive, Zimbabwe continues to witness consolidation of authoritarianism, repression, and the ideology of a one-pin power indefinitely against the aspirations of Zimbabweans who voted for the 2013 Constitution as well as the aspirations of living and fallen heroes of Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle.
The Coalition is fully aware that self-serving politicians and a cartel of corrupt individuals who continue to benefit from the plunder of national resources are behind the push to extend President Mnangagwa’s stay in office.
Regrettably, we continue to witness amendments to the Constitution that have ushered in draconian legislation like the PVO Act which has further shrunk the democratic space in Zimbabwe.
The Coalition reiterates its call for Zimbabweans, across political, ethnic, and social divides, to unite and reject this unconstitutional power grab.
Through our Constitutional Hubs established in various parts of the country, the Coalition will mobilize grassroots communities to resist the illegal extension of President Mnangagwa’s stay in office which symbolizes consolidation of authoritarianism and erosion of democracy.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/ed-term-extension-zimbabweans-must-unite-in-defence-of-the-constitution/,2025-05-30 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

How 2024 exit polls compare with the 2020 and 2016 elections,"President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidency for a second time in a historic comeback. There are some key takeaways in how the country’s politics have shifted over three straight elections with Trump on the ballot.
CNN’s exit poll results from 2016, 2020 and 2024 reveal how a sour economy was a drag on Vice President Kamala Harris, how she failed to drive an uptick in support among women even though there was an uptick in support for abortion rights, and how Latino men, in particular, gravitated toward Trump.
CNN's exit polls for the 2024 general election include interviews with thousands of voters, both those who cast a ballot on Election Day and those who voted early or absentee. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year's election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the election themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they're most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That's particularly true before the exit poll numbers are adjusted to match final election results.
Exit poll data for 2024 will continue to update and will automatically reflect in the charts below.
Women lean toward Harris, and men lean toward Trump
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Gender
Harris’ edge among women this year did not exceed either President Joe Biden’s or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s, a troubling sign for the vice president given that she tried to mobilize female voters on the issue of abortion. Trump maintained an edge among men.
Latino men embraced Trump
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Race/ethnicity and gender
Latino voters, and men in particular, have been moving toward Trump since 2016. This year, Latino men broke in his direction for the first time. Biden won their support by 23 points in 2020 and Trump won them in 2024. Latina women still favored Harris, but by smaller margins than they supported either Clinton or Biden.
Harris maintained strong leads among Black men and women. Trump’s lead among White men shrank.
The educational divide grows
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Education, race and gender
White voters without college degrees have long represented Trump’s base of support, something that has remained constant. A shift has occurred among White college-educated voters. They narrowly backed Trump in 2016, but Harris won them in 2024, a split driven by both men and women. Harris won White women with a college degree by about 15 points — an improvement over both Biden and Clinton. Meanwhile, Harris lost some support among voters of color of all education levels.
Younger voters shifted toward Trump, while he lost ground with senior voters
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Age
Democrats lost some support among the youngest voters, a group that overwhelmingly votes for them. But Harris also made gains among the oldest voters, a group that traditionally leans Republican. It’s an interesting shift.
Trump regained power in rural America
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Where voters live
While Trump lost some support in rural areas in 2020, he returned to full strength there in 2024. Cities remained solidly Democratic. The suburbs stayed the evenly split battleground that decides elections.
Voters are sour on the economy
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
View of the economy
Voters were about evenly split in 2020 on whether the economy was in good shape or not, an incredible thing given the raging pandemic that was affecting Americans’ lives that year. In 2024, about two-thirds of voters said the economy was in bad shape. That shift in sentiment benefited Trump.
More people report their family has fallen behind
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Family’s financial situation today
It makes sense that partisans would say their position has or has not improved based on whether the person they support is in the White House. This year, there’s a big shift. In 2020, just about one-fifth of voters said they were doing worse than four years before. This year, it’s nearly half of voters who say they are doing worse than four years ago. Trump won them overwhelmingly.
More Americans support abortion rights
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Abortion should be:
One story these charts don’t fully tell is how the abortion conversation has changed. In 2016, Roe v. Wade guaranteed every American woman a constitutional right to an abortion. In 2024, that federal right is gone, taken away by a conservative majority Trump helped seat on the Supreme Court. In 2020, about half of Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In 2024, it’s about two-thirds of Americans who say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. But they didn’t necessarily tie that support to their vote for president. About half of people who say abortion should be legal in most cases supported Trump.
Trump made inroads with moderates
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Ideology
Liberals and conservatives have moved even further into their partisan corners during the Trump years. Moderates still favored the Democratic nominee in 2024, but by a smaller margin than in 2020.
Trump is the dominant figure in the election
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
Vote for president mainly:
People who say they cast their vote more in support of their chosen candidate than against their opponent split for Trump, a signal of his popularity among his supporters. Those motivated more by opposition were largely in Harris’ camp. Overall, roughly three-quarters of voters said they were mostly voting to support their candidate, not to oppose their rival.
Trump engaged new voters
Voted for the Democrat
Voted for Trump
First-year voters
Trump’s campaign strategy was built around motivating low-propensity voters who don’t usually take part in the political process. That paid off because there was a dramatic swing between 2020, when Biden won first-year voters, and 2024, when Trump won them. But there’s important context in the fact that a smaller portion of voters reported casting their first ballot in 2024 than in 2020.
CNN exit polls are a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and in-person interviews, telephone and online polls measuring the views of early and absentee by-mail voters. They were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 279 polling locations. The results also include interviews with early and absentee voters conducted between October 24 and November 2, in person at 27 early voting locations, by phone or online. Results for the full sample of 22,914 respondents have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.",https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/,2024-11-06 00:00:00,cnn,politics,"CNN,Zachary B.

"Zanu PF sweeps Insiza, Gutu by-elections amid CCC boycott & voter apathy","According to official results released by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), Delani Moyo of Zanu PF emerged victorious in Insiza North with 7,171 votes, significantly outpacing his closest rival, independent candidate Leslie Dube, who garnered 1,187 votes. Other contenders included ZNRP’s Mbongeni Moyo with 131 votes and ZAPU’s Thabani Mlotshwa, who received 114.
ZEC’s declaration, signed by the constituency elections officer on 14 June, confirmed Moyo as the duly elected Member of Parliament for Insiza North. There was a low voter turnout which stood at 35.9%, with 84 ballots rejected.
In Gutu East, Zanu PF’s Zarevashe Masvingise also secured a landslide victory. There were 194 votes rejected while the voter turnout stood at 48.3%. The result further consolidates Zanu PF’s parliamentary dominance.
The CCC, once Zimbabwe’s main opposition force, did not field candidates in either race, maintaining its boycott of electoral processes it alleges are rigged in favour of the governing Zanu PF.

Former minister Joel Gabbuza injured in axe attack,"Unconfirmed reports claim the assailant was a man who suspected Gabbuza of having an affair with his wife.
Some of the reports falsely suggested that Gabbuza had died from his injuries.
However, in a brief telephone interview, his son confirmed that the former MP is alive and receiving medical care.
“He is receiving treatment at Hwange Colliery Hospital. His condition has improved from last night, he is now able to speak. We are making arrangements to transfer him to Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo,” he said.
Gabbuza served as Minister of Water Resources and Development during Zimbabwe’s Government of National Unity and was the long-serving MP for Binga South.
He served as MP for approximately 23 years. He was first elected in 2000 to represent the Binga constituency under the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Following the 2008 electoral boundary changes, which split Binga into Binga North and Binga South, Gabbuza continued as the MP for Binga South. He retained his seat in subsequent elections, including the 2013 general elections. His tenure concluded in October 2023 after he was recalled by self-proclaimed CCC interim secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/former-minister-joel-gabbuza-injured-in-axe-attack/,2025-08-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

The Chaona massacre of 2008,"By Ngoni Danzva
The militia members belonged to different terror gangs, but notable ones were from the Border Gezi group, who wore an olive green uniform, and others from the Paraquat they wore T Shirts inscribed “Paraquat”, a gang that belonged to Saviour Kasukuwere. But on the day of the attack on Chaona villagers, the groups were led by and under the command of Retired Major General Cairo Mhandu, a former soldier.
They camped at Chaona Primary School in preparation for a brutal assault on innocent civilians the next day. The brutality that followed had to be seen to be believed.
Major General Mhandu instructed his thugs to spread a message to the villagers, ordering anyone and everyone to be at Chaona Primary School by 5 a.m. The villagers were threatened with violence and arson attacks should they fail to show up at the meeting.
The next day, on the 5th of May 2008, villagers across Chiweshe arrived at Chaona Primary School. Fearing for their lives, they had to show up. And to some, this would be their last day alive.
When the villagers finally gathered at Chaona Primary School, Mhandu told the crowd that “this community needs to be taught a lesson.” He ordered the villagers that they must come forward and confess their links and association with the opposition.
The crowd was terrified, and no one stepped forward. After a brief moment of silence, ZANU PF youths grabbed a 76-year-old woman from the crowd and ordered her to lie in front of the crowd on her stomach. They started beating her with sjamboks and sticks on her buttocks. After some minutes, three men came forward and said they were opposition supporters, just to save the old lady from the beatings.
What ensued next was an egregious frenzy of brutality. Over 70 villagers were indiscriminately and severely beaten. Grown men and women groaned in unspeakable pain, cried, and begged for mercy. But no one listened. Their crime was that they had voted for the opposition on the 29th of March general election. It was also a terror campaign intended to discourage them from voting for the opposition in the run-off election, which was scheduled to take place on Friday the 27th of June 2008.
Six men tragically died from the brutal beatings and torture that took place that day. Two of them, Tapiwa Meda and Alex Chirisiri, died on the spot after the beatings. Joseph Madzuramhende died later that day after they had squeezed and crushed his genitals, tying them with a wire. Geoffrey Jemedze and Wilson Emmanuel died at Avenues Clinic on Friday the 9th of May 2008. Fushirai Dofu died on Saturday the 10th of May 2008 at Howard Hospital.
😔
Not only were six murders committed, but also over 30 attempted murders of people who were hospitalized at Howard Hospital, Concession Hospital, and Avenues Clinic. Tens of cases of grievous bodily harm were also committed during the torture sessions.
5 May 2025 marked exactly 17 years since the Chaona attack. No investigations were conducted, and no arrests were made by the Zimbabwe Republic Police for the crimes against humanity that were committed in Chiweshe.
No one was ever brought to justice for the deaths of Joseph Madzuramhende, Tapiwa Meda, Alex Chirisiri, Geoffrey Jemedze, Wilson Emmanuel, and Fushirai Dofu.
Rest in peace, dear comrades. You paid the ultimate price for a noble cause to see a free Zimbabwe, and your names shall forever be inscribed on the corridors of history. You are not forgotten.

Mnangagwa pardons ailing former judge who fled after corruption conviction,"HARARE – President Emmerson Mnangagwa has pardoned former High Court judge Benjamin Paradza who was convicted on corruption charges but fled the country before sentencing in 2006.
Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi announced the full pardon in a Government Gazette published on May 23.
The notice said: “It is hereby notified that His Excellency the President has in terms of section 112(1)(a) and (b) of the constitution, made an order granting pardon for Mr Benjamin Paradza in respect of his conviction (Case Number CRB 152/2004) on two counts of corruption on the 9th January, 2006, by the High Court of Zimbabwe sitting at Harare.”
Paradza, who was admitted as a lawyer by the New Zealand Bar in 2011, is reportedly suffering from a terminal illness and his family has lobbied the government to allow him to return home.
A source familiar with the discussions said: “He is ill and elderly and a war veteran. He needs to be taken care of by his family here.
“If he returns home with that conviction hanging over his head it means he has to be immediately arrested, and it would be actually expensive to incarcerate him because of his medical needs.”
Paradza was tried after he approached three judges – Justice Maphios Cheda, Justice George Chiweshe and Justice Lawrence Kamocha trying to get them to release the passport of his business associate Russell Wayne Labuschagne, who was facing murder allegations.
It was Justice Cheda who caused his arrest after making a secret recording of Paradza stating that Labuschagne, who was eventually jailed 15 years by Kamocha over the death of man who allegedly trespassed into his fish farm in Kariba, needed to attend a convention for professional hunters in the United States.
Paradza told Cheda that he and his partners in Circle G, which was part of the Midland Black Rhino Conservancy in Kwekwe, stood to make US$60,000 if Labuschagne travelled to the United States and clinched deals with hunters.
Cheda also told the trial that he was approached by a Mr Anand who offered him a bribe.
Paradza pleaded his innocence, insisting that he only asked the judges to take a look at the file and exercise their discretion if Labuschagne’s application for a variation of his bail terms, namely the release of his passport held by the Clerk of Court, came before them.
He instead claimed the judges had been sent to trap him because he had passed judgments which were unfavourable to the government.
The pardon means Paradza will never be sentenced.

"Councillor dumps CCC, to contest Insiza North by-election as independent","By Promise Dube
The seat fell vacant following the death of Farai Taruvinga who was the MP since 2018 on a Zanu PF ticket. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced that the nomination court will sit on 15 May and the by-election will be held on 14 June 2025.
Dube was elected as a councillor under the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) during the 2023 harmonised elections. However, he has now opted to run without party affiliation, citing challenges within the CCC.
“Since there have been numerous issues with CCC and the brand is currently struggling, I plan to run as an independent candidate,” said Dube.
He acknowledged that the decision was not taken lightly and came after considerable reflection.
“I have received advice to stand as an independent, but I’m doing so with a heavy heart,” he said. “It is my hope that party leaders will eventually sit down and resolve the issues. I would have loved to stand under my party, but the situation on the ground is not conducive.”
Dube said his decision to run for Parliament was informed by the work he has done at ward level and growing calls from constituents for him to expand his impact.
“I have made the decision to run for MP because I have been doing a lot of good work as a councillor for Ward 15, and my voters are telling me I should do even more,” he said.
During his tenure as councillor, Dube said he gained insight into the challenges affecting the broader Insiza North district and is now seeking to address them at a higher level.
“I would like to work with fellow councillors in the constituency and help them develop their areas,” he said. “I want to take that spirit to the constituency and cover all the wards in Insiza North because I’ve done great work in Ward 15.”
If elected, Dube said he will prioritise improving the constituency’s poor infrastructure.
“I will be working hard to bring improvements, because there are no roads, very few schools and clinics, and the infrastructure is generally poor,” he said.
He also disclosed that he will self-fund part of his campaign, but is open to support.
“I am financially secure because I work as a miner in Filabusi, but I am also open to donations from anyone who wishes to help,” said Dube.
He added that he is open to collaborating with members across the political divide if they are committed to development.
“As long as it involves development, I am willing to collaborate with any Member of Parliament,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/councillor-dumps-ccc-to-contest-insiza-north-by-election-as-independent/,2025-05-14 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,
Police under fire over fresh allegations of brutality and abuse,"By Promise Dube
Human rights lawyer Arnold Tsunga says these cases reflect a disturbing pattern of abuse by law enforcement officers against civilians, vendors, and even learners, warning that impunity remains a central problem.
In March, nearly 100 people were arrested during protests in Harare. According to Tsunga, most of those detained were not involved in the demonstration but were picked up while commuting home from work.
“When they appeared in court, it became clear that the majority had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Tsunga said . “Detaining people in such circumstances under filthy conditions amounts to abuse of police power.”
Public anger has also been fuelled by the death of 30-year-old Blessed Believe Juruvenge, who died after allegedly being severely beaten by Constable Prince Ndavambi while in police custody at Ruwa Police Station last month.
Ndavambi reportedly assaulted Juruvenge with a hoe handle, while fellow officers allegedly watched without intervening. After weeks on the run, Ndavambi was arrested on 12 June.
In a separate incident in Maphisa, Matabeleland South, police conducting a crime awareness campaign at Mahetshe Primary School reportedly beat several pupils, including toddlers, sparking national outcry.
Witnesses said uniformed officers slapped and caned the learners, leaving some injured and in tears. Parents and rights groups have condemned the incident as unlawful and degrading, prompting a government investigation.
“The police are not mandated to discipline schoolchildren,” Tsunga said, describing the incident as a gross abuse of authority.
The fresh allegations have revived memories of Zimbabwe’s post-election violence in 2018, when soldiers opened fire on protesters in Harare, killing six people. Despite a commission of inquiry led by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe recommending prosecutions, no action has been taken against those responsible.
“These cases demonstrate a systematic failure to hold security forces accountable,” Tsunga said. “There is a clear pattern of excessive and unlawful force, which fosters public fear and distrust.”
He urged the police to adhere strictly to principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, and accountability in maintaining public order.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/police-under-fire-over-fresh-allegations-of-brutality-and-abuse/,2025-06-13 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Disgruntled former ZAPU members launch new party,"The new party is led by Matthew Sibanda, one of five former senior ZAPU officials from Matabeleland South who were expelled in 2022 for opposing the candidacy of Sibangilizwe Nkomo, son of the late ZAPU founding leader Joshua Nkomo, in the party’s presidential race.
The group, commonly referred to as the “Mat South Five” comprising Sibanda, Gideon Dlamini, Echem Nkala, Ernest Ndlovu and Mildred Mkandla accused Nkomo of leveraging his father’s legacy to secure votes at the 2021 congress despite lacking the necessary credentials.
The five had served ZAPU in various provincial and national capacities since 2011.
However, they were expelled in November 2022 after raising concerns about irregularities in Nkomo’s election, alleging that Nkomo garnered 121 votes, even though only 105 delegates were registered to vote.
After their concerns were dismissed internally, the group sought legal recourse in June 2023 but the Bulawayo High Court upheld Nkomo’s nomination and confirmed his presidency of ZAPU.
Despite the legal setback, Sibanda, now interim president of O ZAPU, insisted that their goal was not to create a new political party but to restore the original ZAPU, which he claimed had strayed from its founding principles under Nkomo’s leadership.
“In fact, we are not forming a new party. We are reviving the original ZAPU because the party’s constitution was violated when Sibangilizwe took over the presidency,” Sibanda said during the launch held last Saturday in Bulawayo.
Sibanda argued that ZAPU had lost direction and relevance under Nkomo’s tenure.
“During the previous elections, the party failed to field candidates for both council and parliamentary seats in Bulawayo. Even the president himself did not contest,” he noted.
Sibanda pledged that O ZAPU would institute reforms and prioritise national development if elected into power.
“We will focus on infrastructure development and revamping the country’s ailing healthcare system,” he stated.
Sibanda also insisted Nkomo’s leadership as ZAPU president was illegitimate, claiming he was not a registered party member at the time of his election and had never held any official position within the party structures.
“I was ZAPU’s chairperson for Matabeleland South, and I can confirm that Sibangilizwe was not in any structures in the province. The ZAPU constitution is very clear, one must rise through the ranks, from branch level to national, to be eligible for leadership,” he said.
He went further to accuse Nkomo of forging his party credentials to qualify for the 2021 presidential contest.
“Sibangilizwe was simply imposed because he is the son of the party’s late commander,” Sibanda claimed.
The launch of O ZAPU was attended by Mthwakazi Republic Party (MRP) vice president Sibongile Banda and the party’s Secretary for Legal Affairs, Nkosilathi Khanye.
Some ZAPU delegates from all ten provinces also attended the event while Stylish Magida was introduced as the interim Secretary General of the new formation.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/disgruntled-former-zapu-members-launch-new-party/,2025-06-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Gukurahundi hearings to be held in private as media barred,"Deputy President of the National Council of Chiefs, Chief Fortune Charumbira, told a press conference in Bulawayo that the process will follow a victim-centred approach to safeguard the dignity, safety and privacy of survivors of the 1980s atrocities.
“Our approach is victim-centred. These are not public hearings,” he said. “Because of the sensitivities involved and the private nature of some of the testimonies, such accounts cannot be shared openly.”
He stressed that even multiple victims from the same community would not appear together. Instead, each will be seen individually by a 14-member local panel, led by the area’s chief, with time slots arranged to ensure privacy.
“Victims will appear one at a time. A chief may, for example, hear one victim in the morning and another in the afternoon. Victims may only bring one or two close family members if they wish,” Charumbira said.
The hearings will be overseen by local chiefs supported by a panel comprising elders, religious leaders, youth and women’s representatives, as well as counselling experts, all drawn from the chief’s jurisdiction to maintain cultural sensitivity.
When asked if victims could choose to speak to the media outside the hearings, Charumbira firmly replied: “No.”
He explained that the restriction was intended to prevent re-traumatisation and social stigma for victims whose accounts may expose deeply personal or painful experiences.
“These are private matters. Like certain court cases held in camera, these hearings are confidential to protect the victim’s well-being,” he said.
Charumbira revealed that previous efforts to agree on media access guidelines with government and journalists had stalled.
“We met with the Ministry of Information to explore media involvement, and the media fraternity was tasked to propose a code of conduct. To date, no such framework has been submitted,” he said.
Despite this, Charumbira insisted that media attendance would remain inappropriate given the sensitivity of the proceedings.
“Some revelations could damage a victim’s standing in the community forever. We cannot risk that,” he warned. “Even if media were to be excluded after the fact, information might already be leaked or misused.”
Responding to concerns that barring the media contradicts the principle of transparency, Charumbira argued that openness lies in providing victims with a safe platform to speak.
“The openness is to the victims, not the public. The public will be informed through official briefings. What is important is the final report, not individual stories,” he said.
Charumbira assured journalists that the National Council of Chiefs would issue periodic updates on the hearings’ progress.
“Regular media briefings will be held by the President of the Council of Chiefs to keep the public informed,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/gukurahundi-hearings-to-be-held-in-private-as-media-barred/,2025-06-16 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

Security agent blocks opposition MP’s engagement meeting,"TellZim News Reporter
A Central Intelligence Officer (CIO) in Chiredzi is alleged to have obstructed Chiredzi Central Constituency Member of Parliament, Ropafadzo Makumire from carrying out his engagement soccer tournament at Chishamiso Stadium recently despite the meeting having been explicitly approved by both the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ) TellZim News reports.
The MP recently held an interface meeting at Chishamiso Stadium in Hippo Valley to engage the electorate and the event included various sporting activities, such as soccer and netball.
However, the activities were disrupted when the officer, Tinashe Muyambo, parked his black Toyota GD6 at the centre of the stadium drinking beer with his friends for about three hours.
Makumire confirmed the incident to TellZim News and condemned Muyambo’s disruptive behaviour and went on to thank the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and the Central Intelligence Office for their quick intervention in handling the situation.
“The situation instilled fear within the community due to this individual’s presence. Many residents were understandably upset and felt the need to take action, but we intervened to maintain peace.
“It is important to acknowledge the police and officials from the president’s office who swiftly removed him from the ground. We hold the office of the President to a higher standard and do not accept such behaviour. This situation must be addressed to restore confidence in our community. The programme was intended to engage with the community to discuss pressing issues and provide feedback to the people,” said Makumire.
The meeting had been sanctioned by the Zimbabwe Republic Police to begin at 0900 hours and end at 1730 hours, but the meeting started later at 1200 hours due to Muyambo’s actions.
Hippo Valley Community Services Officer, Brawl Chikandiwa had written to Makumire giving him permission to hold the interface meeting at Chishamiso Stadium with some set guidelines including informing the police and maintaining cleanliness.
“I write to inform you that your request has been granted. You are free to use the requested; however, you are advised to make arrangements to inform and avail ZRP for peace and security and ensure the highest level of cleanliness during and after use,” wrote Chikandiwa.
Muyambo had been Makumire’s critic way before he was transferred from Chikombedzi to Chiredzi Office and his behaviour retards development.
There has been delays in the construction of Melbourne Government Primary School, where Makumire channelled part of his Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to pay for labour which is allegedly being attributed to political interference.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/security-agent-blocks-opposition-mps-engagement-meeting/,2025-08-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,

CCC MPs refuse to ‘protect and secure’ Mnangagwa’s Belarus deals,"HARARE – President Emmerson Mnangagwa presided over the signing of several Memorandum of Understanding with Belarus in Minsk on Tuesday, but opposition legislators refused to approve an agreement meant to “protect and secure” Belarusian investments in Zimbabwe.
Sheila Chikomo, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, presented the memorandum of agreement in the National Assembly seeking ratification of the agreement on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments.
She said parliament should approve the agreement by May 31, 2025.
President Mnangagwa signed the agreement in 2023 but it does not bind Zimbabwe until it has been approved by parliament.
A parliamentary committee on foreign affairs also recommended that the agreement be approved because it presents a significant opportunity for Zimbabwe to promote investment, foster sustainable development and strengthen economic ties.
Opposition Citizens Coalition for Change MPs voiced disquiet.
“The coincidence of the minister bringing this agreement before this August House was designed to be timed with the president’s official visit currently happening,” said Edwin Mushoriwa, MP for Dzivarasekwa.
Mushoriwa said parliament cannot approve the agreement without full information on the balance of trade between Belarus and Zimbabwe.
“We also need to be worried when we end up having a trade agreement which can be manipulated and exploited by few individuals who are connected.”
Mbizo MP Corban Madziwanyika said the agreement would only benefit Belarus since Zimbabwe will only be importing finished products including tractors.
Another MP Mutsa Murombedzi said “parliament should not become a rubber stamp for executive deals.”
“It’s a document that potentially grants disapproportionate power to foreign capital with little accountability. I therefore call upon this house to defer the approval,” she said.
Zanu PF MPs among them Supa Mandiwanzira vociferously pushed for the agreement’s approval.

Key points
All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable
When audiences use BBC Online, they need to be confident that our decisions on links and feeds are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests.
A link must never be included on the Public Service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.
An external site which is a candidate for a link should, generally, be relevant to the BBC content from which a link is envisaged; meet the expectations of the likely audience.
The producer must check the contents of the external site before adding a link to a BBC page.
In order to maintain impartiality, BBC sites which cover matters of controversy or public policy may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject.
For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme’s viewers and listeners.
When linking to any commercial site, great care must be taken to avoid giving the impression that the BBC is endorsing a commercial product or service.
Links from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC’s Commercial sites are acceptable only when clearly editorially justified.
It is likely to be editorially justifiable to link directly to the source of tickets if the event for which the tickets are being sold is a BBC Event. If not, a link to eg the band’s own site would be editorially justifiable, from where a user can click to the ticket agency’s site.
Before offering automatically generated links to external sites from BBC content, a number of factors should be considered, including the genre of editorial content, the ability to select from appropriate recognised and reputable sources and how to remove links from specific stories quickly.
Pulling third party feeds onto BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally, because users are more likely to expect the feeds to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards.
The person responsible for the page on which a feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed.
When we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about this with our users.
We should be clear about what our users can do and where they should go if they see a mistake or find something offensive.
It should be clear to a casual user that an inbound embed (for example, of video from a social networking site) is not under the editorial control of the BBC and is not primarily the responsibility of the BBC. But we are responsible for deciding what non-BBC content to embed on BBC pages and we should be alert to the possibility of the original content being changed or removed and to rights issues.

For advice on distribution, including syndication, see Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Distribution 16.3.14 – 16.3.16
Introduction
The BBC’s global reputation is based on its editorial integrity and independence. Our audiences need to be confident that our decisions are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests. We must not undermine these values by any actions which could bring the BBC into disrepute.
The Editorial Guidelines state that:
our impartiality, editorial integrity and independence must not be compromised by outside interests and arrangements we must maintain independent editorial control over our content
we must not give undue prominence to products, services or trade marks, though we can refer to them and credit them where it is editorially justified
The BBC will not accept product placement on its UK Public Services, and Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services, trade marks, activities or opinions. While our Commercial Services must not promote products, services and trade marks in their content, they can make reference to another organisation, its products, services, trade marks or activities as part of a commercial arrangement. If they do, they must follow the guidelines on product placement, and on advertising and sponsorship which explain that it is not appropriate to make deals with some types of organisation.
on air and online credits must be clearly editorially justified
(See also Editorial Guidelines Section 14: Independence from External Interests: Introduction 14.1 and Logos and Credits Online 14.3.21)
Links to external sites
Whenever producers are creating content on a BBC site, they should actively consider which external websites it may be editorially justifiable to link to.
Editorial justification for linking to external sites
Producers may wish to offer links to external sites for a number of reasons, including:
for further relevant information
for further background information or other key source material
for useful practical information
for further informed comment
A link must never be included on the public service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.
All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable and suitable for the intended audience – particularly children.
Links are not acceptable as a form of credit.
Editorial checks
Producers must check the contents of the site which is signposted before adding a link to a BBC page, although responsibility for including the link lies with the relevant editor.
Where this is practical, we should consider ways to make it easy for users who find broken, stale or inappropriate external BBC links to report these to us so that we can check, update, replace or remove them.
Disclaimers
Where we publish a list of links we should add the standard disclaimer to the effect that ""the BBC is not responsible for the contents of any other sites listed"". If the links are to controversial or challenging material, it may be appropriate to add a specific disclaimer and more information, closer to the links, even when there are only one or two links on a page. For “in story” links to such material, for example to very sensitive content such as a gruelling account of torture, it may be helpful to alert the user to this, in context, as part of telling the story.
Links to sites which do not share BBC editorial values
Context is important in deciding whether a link is appropriate and it is often useful to explain why we are offering the link. In some cases we may offer a link to a site which does not share our editorial values, but which offers a useful insight. For example we might link from a current affairs page to the site of a government-run national news agency so that the user can see the precise words used in a government statement.
Controversial content
We must be duly impartial. BBC sites which cover a controversial or public policy matter may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject. We should ensure that when we link to third party sites that we take into account any concerns about potential breaches of the law, for example, defamation or incitement to racial hatred.
Where content is likely to cause serious offence to some users and yet there is a strong editorial justification for covering the story, it may be editorially justifiable for the BBC to link to the relevant site rather than to host the content ourselves.
Charities
Links to charity sites have to be based on sensible editorial criteria. If one charity is in the news, it may be appropriate to establish a link to the site of that charity. But we must take care not to promote one charity above another. If we are giving advice or general information about the subject and wish to refer to a charity and there is a range of charities working in the field, we should normally link to the other significant charities working in the field as well. This guidance applies to online links offered by BBC Action Lines.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: BBC Support Services 14.3.26)
We should also consider where on the charity website we link to – for example it may be appropriate to link to useful sources of information, but not to campaigning or fundraising pages.
Programme Support
For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's viewers and listeners. If we give a link to an outside advice agency from a support page, we should give links to a reasonable range of other relevant agencies as well.
Where a consumer programme reviews a product or service, we should only offer links to the sites of the manufacturers, suppliers or retailers of any goods or services mentioned where strictly editorially justifiable.
Undue prominence
There must be no undue prominence of products, services or trade marks in our content.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Product Prominence 14.3.1)
Public Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services or trademarks, so great care must be taken when linking to any site in order not to give the impression that the BBC is doing so.
BBC Public Service sites should not normally link direct to pages whose main purpose is transactional e.g. selling merchandise, downloads or tickets.
See exceptions below for links to buy BBC-related programme content and links to buy tickets for BBC Events. There are some occasions where we may also wish to link directly to a donations page for a BBC charitable appeal.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing: Charities 16.3.43)
If in any doubt, refer to Editorial Policy.
Links from BBC Public Services to the BBC’s Commercial sites
General points:
Links from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC’s Commercial sites (e.g. those operated by BBC Studios and BBC Global News Ltd) are acceptable only when editorially justified. We should not be seen to promote the BBC’s Commercial sites and we should not link to such sites in preference to other editorially relevant sites.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Public Service References to BBC Commercial sites 14.3.23
For links from an individual Public Service page to a corresponding BBC Commercial page which features BBC branded products see Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests: Trails for Commercial Products related to BBC Programmes.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 : Independence from External Interests: Trails for Commercial Products related to BBC Programmes 14.3.24
Where appropriate, an interstitial page may appear on the user's journey between the Public Service site and the BBC’s Commercial site. It will let users know that they are leaving the public service site and offer them a choice.
For transactional links from Public Service Platforms to Commercial Products Related to BBC Editorial Content see Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests.
See Editorial Guidelines Section 14 Independence from External Interests: Transactional links from Public Service Platforms to Commercial Products Related to BBC Editorial Content 14.3.25
Links to buy tickets
BBC programmes and sites regularly cover music concerts and tours. Linking policy to sites where users can buy tickets will depend on the nature of the event.
If it is a BBC mounted or run event (on the Public Services to contribute to the BBC’s Mission and Public Purposes), then a direct link to the source of the tickets is likely to be editorially justifiable.
(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16 External Relationships and Financing Ticket Sales 16.3.34)
If it is not a BBC mounted or run event (and where for example a BBC network is simply broadcasting a concert organised by someone else) then a direct link to the relevant band’s site is likely to be editorially justifiable, with one more click from there to the ticket agency’s site.
Part 2: Inbound feeds and embeds
Pulling third-party content on to BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally. Following an external link takes you away from the BBC site and users have a chance to adjust their expectations in the light of that journey. But as third party content sits with BBC content on BBC branded pages, users are more likely to expect it to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards before being published on our site.
Editorial responsibility
The person who is editorially responsible for the page on which the feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed. This principle will apply whether it is a bespoke feed to a single page or a general feed to many pages.
We would not normally embed a live feed of video or text unless we had a contractual relationship with the supplier that provides assurances about the content or we could be otherwise confident that the content is appropriate to be shared on our own platforms.
Transparency
Where we take in content from an external supplier, we should be transparent about it with our users. Attribution should be as close as possible to the content in question.
We should provide a clear and easy route for our users to report a mistake or find offensive or inappropriate content on a feed.
Embeds
Embedded video, for example of a social networking site video player such as YouTube or Vimeo on a BBC page, may be a useful way to display editorially relevant non-BBC content.
Even though the content is not under our control it appears to the audience that it is part of our online content. We should therefore make it clear that the embedded video is from a third party site and give the audience a direct route to report to the relevant editorial team any inappropriate content, such as advertising, that might appear on that video.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidance/feeds-and-links,,bbc,politics,

"Wary of Global Tensions, Zimbabwe Holds Interest Rates at 35%","Zimbabwe, wary of a rise in global tensions, resolved to leave its bank policy rate unchanged at 35%, according to John Mushayavanhu, the central bank governor.
“The MPC noted the broad-based deceleration of global growth occasioned by escalating trade tensions, geo-economic fragmentation, regional and international conflicts and policy uncertainty,” Mushayavanhu said in a statement Monday after a surprise meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. “Considering the challenging and rapidly evolving risks to the global growth outlook, the MPC advised the Reserve Bank to maintain a sufficiently tight monetary policy stance.”
The central bank was set to hold a rate setting meeting only later this month on June 27, according to a schedule available on its website. Despite, the current uncertain global environment, the bank said it still sees 6% growth in the domestic economy as achievable this year. The strong performance of agriculture is expected to help spur the expansion after improved output from key crops including corn, tobacco and cotton.
“Other sectors are also expected to record positive growth performance, benefiting from the prevailing price and exchange rate stability,” Mushayavanhu added.
The southern African nation has kept rates unchanged since it lifted them last September in response to a sharp devaluation of its gold-backed currency, the ZiG. Businesses have repeatedly asked the central bank to reconsider its tight monetary policy stance, which is causing a severe liquidity crunch in the economy.
The bank maintains that its policy has helped stabilize the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, and is seeing increased usage in the economy. It is now used in 43% of transactions in the economy up from 26% last April, according to the governor. The foreign currency reserves backing the ZiG stood at $701 million as of last Friday.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/wary-of-global-tensions-zimbabwe-holds-interest-rates-at-35/,2025-06-17 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Zimbabwe says gold-backed currency stable but investor doubts persist,"HARARE – Zimbabwe’s gold-backed currency now has more than 100 percent reserve cover and is stable, according to the central bank, but doubts over its credibility remain, underscored by a persistent premium in the parallel market.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on Monday kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 35 percent, citing a stable exchange rate, opens new tab as one of the reasons, and reported total reserves of $701 million. The bank said the portion of transactions carried out using the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency surged to 43 percent in May from 26 percent in April 2024, the month it was introduced.
Decades of economic instability and currency devaluations mean most people still use the U.S. dollar for most purchases. But the authorities are hoping the ZiG’s gold backing will give Zimbabweans the confidence to adopt it for everyday transactions.
“ZiG is our national currency, and as the central bank, we are committed to ensuring its success by maintaining all the fundamental characteristics of sound money, including its function as a reliable store of value,” Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavanhu wrote in response to Reuters’ questions.
“The Reserve Bank has learned from previous currency failures that maintaining optimum money supply and ensuring monetary stability is vital,” he added.
Despite the bank’s assurances, the gap between the official exchange rate and parallel market rate remains about 20 percent.
“The rate has been stable for more than three months,” said black-market trader Pearson Tambudze, attributing the stability to a scarcity of the local currency rather than restored confidence.
“There isn’t a lot of ZiG in the market,” he said.
The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the ZiG’s stability but is urging Zimbabwe to adopt tighter money-growth limits, a more transparent foreign exchange market and to make progress on clearing an estimated $12.2 billion in external arrears.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, meanwhile, expressed hope last month that currency stability and appropriate monetary policy would enable Zimbabwe to raise $2.6 billion in bridge finance by mid-2026.
Investors, however, remain cautious.
“We wouldn’t invest in Zimbabwe at the current stages. The country needs to have a lot more development before we would consider it,” said Jetro Siekkinen at LGT Capital Partners.
Economists also flagged concerns over Zimbabwe’s reserve cushion, which stands at 0.8 months of import cover, well short of the IMF’s recommended three-month safety net.
“In terms of priority, I would consider the clearance of arrears with multilateral creditors to be most important,” said Lyle Begbie, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Two earlier IMF staff-monitored programmes collapsed within 15 months, and Begbie predicted similar outcomes for future efforts.
“Ultimately, we are likely years away from the IMF providing concessional financing to Zimbabwe, even if the country does everything right, which itself is not likely,” he said. – Reuters

Zimbabwe residents lose funds to illegal Bitcoin trading company,"Residents in Zimbabwe have lost funds to a fraudulent trading platform that advertises crypto investment opportunities on Facebook. According to reports, the investment platform masquerades as InnBucks Investment, luring innocent people into depositing their funds using Ecocash, which is moved to the fake trading platform.
According to local reports, the platform promises residents in Zimbabwe the opportunity to make profits from Bitcoin trading, agreeing to trade the asset on their behalf. They are asked to register accounts on the Amexcyp Market platform using their specialized link.
“Here is an opportunity to make x3 of your investment without any hidden fees or withdrawal fees 100% safe and secure. And also have access to your trading account. Send us a message now to start,” one of their advertisement posts reads.
Zimbabwe residents lose funds to bogus investment platform
According to reports, the platform has other types of advertisements spread across Facebook, targeting unsuspecting residents of the country. “Other platforms may falter, but we remain the best place for safe and secure coins trading in Zimbabwe. Trade on InnBucks investment today!” another post read.
However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. “Stay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels—call us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,” InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform’s posts.
According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24, the fake trading platform’s posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account.
Upon enquiry, “Chiunda” mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister’s name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked.
Fake investment officer reveals operations
Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,” she said.
She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register.
For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50.
She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/zimbabwe-residents-lose-funds-to-illegal-bitcoin-trading-company/,2025-09-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,
Fear and Greed Index - Investor Sentiment,"What is the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index?
The Fear & Greed Index is a way to gauge stock market movements and whether stocks are fairly priced. The theory is based on the logic that excessive fear tends to drive down share prices, and too much greed tends to have the opposite effect.
How is Fear & Greed Calculated?
The Fear & Greed Index is a compilation of seven different indicators that measure some aspect of stock market behavior. They are market momentum, stock price strength, stock price breadth, put and call options, junk bond demand, market volatility, and safe haven demand. The index tracks how much these individual indicators deviate from their averages compared to how much they normally diverge. The index gives each indicator equal weighting in calculating a score from 0 to 100, with 100 representing maximum greediness and 0 signaling maximum fear.
How often is the Fear & Greed Index calculated?
Every component and the Index are calculated as soon as new data becomes available.
How to use Fear & Greed Index?
The Fear & Greed Index is used to gauge the mood of the market.

Zimbabwe to ban export of lithium concentrates from 2027,"HARARE – Zimbabwe will ban the export of lithium concentrates from 2027 as it extends its push for more local processing, mines minister Winston Chitando said on Tuesday.
Africa’s top producer of lithium, used in batteries to power renewable energy technologies, banned the export of lithium ore in 2022 and has been pushing miners to process more domestically.
Lithium miners in Zimbabwe, who are mostly from China, have been exporting concentrates to their home country.
Chitando said lithium sulphate plants were currently being developed at two Zimbabwean mines, Bikita Minerals, owned by Sinomine, opens and Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe, owned by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt.
Lithium sulphate is an intermediate product which can be refined into a battery-grade material such as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate used in battery manufacturing.
“Because of that capacity which is now in the country, the export of all lithium concentrates will be banned from January 2027,” Chitando said during a media briefing following a weekly cabinet meeting.
In 2023, Zimbabwe gave lithium miners up to March 2024 to submit plans for developing local refineries, but softened its stance after prices of the metal collapsed.
Sinomine and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt are part of a group of Chinese firms, including Chengxin Lithium Group, Yahua Group and Canmax Technologies, which have spent more than $1 billion since 2021 to acquire and develop lithium projects in Zimbabwe. – Reuters

Beekeepers in Rural Zimbabwe Embrace Technology to Unlock Progress,"Fadziso Mudzingwa sighed in frustration. It was June 2024, the middle of winter in Zimbabwe, and the low temperatures were killing her bees.
She was tired, too—she’d spent the day trekking between her home and her hives in the forest, checking them frequently in the hope of saving both the colonies and her barely profitable honey business.
Despite her protective gear, Fadziso had been stung twice, and she was falling behind in her other tasks. The sun was setting, and her children were waiting for dinner.
She didn’t know it yet, but everything was about to change for the better. She was about to take part in a pilot project in her hometown, Marondera, led by the Internet Society Zimbabwe Chapter, learning to monitor hive conditions remotely and in real time using a mobile app connected to smart sensors.
This technology would truly make a difference—one year later, Fadziso’s work is much easier and her hives are thriving, as is her business. While she sold just 50 liters of honey in 2024, before the project began, she has already produced 130 liters in the first half of 2025.
An Industry in Need of Solutions
Beekeeping can be profitable in Zimbabwe, especially as people commonly use honey and other apiary products—beeswax, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly—for medicinal purposes. The industry is also a positive force for the environment, acting as a catalyst for forest renewal and biodiversity conservation through plant pollination.
Yet things weren’t always positive for Marondera beekeepers, most of whom faced challenges similar to Fadziso’s. Chamunorwa Rupiya also struggled to juggle multiple responsibilities. “As the owner of a tuck shop, I needed to pay someone to fill in for me while I was away inspecting my hives,” he said.
Many struggled to find time to sell products. “I spent most of my days tending to my bees,” said John Chivamba. “I worried about them constantly. Then, when I had the chance, I would go and sell honey on the road leading to Harare.”
And when poor conditions or predators harmed their colonies, the resulting drop in yields meant greater financial hardship for beekeepers.
Monitoring Beehives Remotely
In late 2024, the Zimbabwe Chapter launched a project designed to solve these challenges and safeguard the beekeepers’ livelihoods as well as the community’s food security. Partnering with Shift Organic Technologies and the Harare Institute of Technology, they developed an Internet of Things (IoT) solution comprising hive sensors and a user-friendly mobile app.
Beekeepers can use this app to check factors such as temperature, humidity, and bee activity at a glance, from anywhere, without having to open up their hives or disturb the bees. The data collected can also predict potential health issues and environmental changes, enabling farmers to take proactive measures.
This project, called IoT for Apiary Analytics, included training for the beekeepers. The 20 initial participants not only learned to use the technology but also received instruction in advanced techniques, such as protecting hives from winter temperatures.
“The trainers taught us which flowers to plant around our hives so our bees can always get their favorite pollen,” said Fadziso. “We also learned to set up water points to maintain the hives’ natural humidity.”
Technology Changes the Game
Being able to monitor their hives remotely has revolutionized beekeeping for Fadziso, Chamunorwa, and John. “Now, instead of hiking into the forest first thing every morning, I simply look at my phone for hive updates,” said Fadziso. “I can check on them in minutes, not hours, so I have more time for my children, household chores, and developing new products like floor wax.”
This IoT solution has been a game changer! I can now keep an eye on my bees while selling honey on the road. I make more money and enjoy peace of mind.”
John Chivamba
Meanwhile, Chamunorwa saves money by relying on hired help less often, since he can manage his hives from his shop.
The project has yielded undeniable improvements in bee health and hive productivity. “My production has risen 30 percent and the wax quality is better too,” said Fadziso. Chamunorwa has seen similar improvements, noting that his colonies have grown since the installation of the devices.
Charting the Path Forward
Looking to the future, the beekeepers plan to invest their extra earnings in more sensors to expand their businesses. “My new aim is to sell in major cities, like Harare and Bulawayo, and even to export my honey!” Fadziso said with a smile.
They hope to see further tech innovations in areas such as pest management and honey harvesting. Learning to build the IoT sensors locally to bring down their cost is another goal.
All agree that embracing technology has been life-changing.
Being part of this project means a lot to me. It’s empowered me to take control of my work and improve my family’s quality of life.”

Human rights - a huge step forward for Africa,"rs.
We now look forward to the continental body distancing itself from its lily-livered past, where it remained culpably silent in the face of mounting evidence of atrocities by various African dictators.
There are several sickening examples of this complicity – notably the massacres in Uganda under Idi Amin, Ethiopia under Mengistu, Somalia under Siad Barre, Charles Taylor in Sierra Leone and Zaire (now DRC) under Mobutu. The list is endless.
However, we find it disturbing that, after passing a resolution condemning Zimbabwe, the commission authorities seemed reluctant to publicise the matter. The report had to be leaked to the press by a conscientious official who was dismayed by hush-up attempts in the higher echelons of power.
The failure by the African Commission on human and peoples’ rights to release a formal statement gave the Zimbabwe government an ideal opportunity to deny, initially, the existence of any such report.
When it became obvious that the report was indeed official, the Mugabe regime attacked it – predictably and childishly accusing the commission of kowtowing to western paymasters.
We utterly reject the double-speak by the AU – and the South African government for that matter – who try to justify quiet diplomacy by arguing that they want to avoid antagonising Mugabe, in the hope that he will be more amenable to persuasion. Some hope. If they cannot read the writing on the wall by now, after five years of madness, their powers of judgment and discernment are questionable to say the least.
The fundamental flaw in their premise is that Mugabe is a reasonable man who can, sooner or later, be made to see the error of his ways and thus change. What a fallacy! Mugabe is well aware that he is transgressing all the AU’s, and indeed the world’s most fundamental human rights principles. He is resorting to this because it is the only way to stay in power. The majority of Zimbabweans have made it abundantly clear that they no long want him or Zanu (PF) to govern them.
African leaders must simply condemn and isolate him. He should be left under no illusion that there is any vestige of support for him on the continent. The credibility of the African Union and its organs, including of course South Africa as the continental powerhouse, are at stake. Africa’s leaders ignore this watershed at their peril.

Sport 25,"tional Cricket Council three years ago after a bitter row with white players but have remained in their posts.
Senior white players led by former captain Heath Streak packed their bags, leaving young Tatenda Taibu to lead a group of inexperienced players to massive defeats. Taibu was to follow two years later, also citing leadership problems.
The Zimbabwean has spoken to sources within provincial structures who revealed a plan to “make cricket ungovernable for Chingoka”.
“We were shocked once again. But it is the same story of rigging and manipulation of the structures that enabled Chingoka to bounce back,” said a veteran cricket administrator, on condition of anonymity.
A leader of one of the provinces added, “It has become an embarrassment that we seem to imply a serious lack of capable people in this country. The irony of it is we have just suffered another embarrassment in losing to Bangladesh, and the young players, who they thought would be used to cover up for their madness, are also frustrated.
“We are mobilising for serious measures that must make Chingoka realise he is no longer wanted. Cricket belongs to the grassroots and so we shall make it ungovernable, for Chingoka to go.”
Efforts to obtain comment from Chingoka and Ozias Bvute were unsuccessful.
Foreign levy on athletes mooted
HARARE Hard-pressed Zimbabwean athletes making a beeline to South Africa to compete in lucrative events across the border will have to think again, as the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe are proposing to introduce a clearance levy of $500 000 per race.
NAAZ already collects 10% of the athletes’ foreign prize money.
The latest proposal is seen as a move to stem the tide of athletes leaving the country for greener pastures.
Samukeliso Moyo, a regular runner on the South African circuit and a representative of the Athletes Commission, described the levy as ‘robbing a living from the suffering athletes’.
The levy was supposed to be adopted at the NAAZ Annual General Meeting held in Gweru last December, but was turned down by the Athletes Commission, who threatened to withdraw from national duty.
The athletes said they would not be taking part in the All Africa Games in July if an exorbitant levy was introduced.
Moyo said, “We have no other jobs besides running. We earn our living from running and NAAZ want to take that away from us. How many athletes can afford to fork out $350 000 each time they are going out of the country to compete in the races? We are against this levy.
“Besides, it is the norm that they (NAAZ) collect 10% of our prize money. It’s unfair and we need to consult,” Moyo fumed.
“We hardly have a race in Zimbabwe that has prize money of $500 000, and proposing a levy of $350 000 for one to compete outside the country is very unfair. Most of the athletes are going to South Africa because there are no paying races in Zimbabwe. We are going outside the country to earn a living. Running is all that we know,” Moyo said.
David Leboho, the NAAZ treasurer, said they were going ahead with the levy but would hold further negotiations with the Athletes Commission on the ‘figures’.
Leboho said, “There is an influx of Zimbabwe athletes in South Africa. They are a thorn in the flesh for the South Africans because they are dominating most of the races like the Comrades Marathon, City to City and Two Oceans. The South Africans are not happy but there is nothing they can do. Currently there is no law in place prohibiting foreigners competing in their races”.
Some of the athletes who have made South Africa their second home are Kudakwashe Kanduna, Thabita Tsatsa, Rutendo Nyahoza, Moyo, Marko Mambo, Oliver Kandiero, Cuthbert Nyasango, Tsungai Mwenengeni, Elijah Mutandiro and Elmore Sibanda. – CAJ News.
Dube bout marks new era
BULAWAYO – National heavyweight boxing champion Tamsanqa Dube is set to benefit from sporting relations recently established between Zimbabwe and South Africa when he takes part in an eight-rounder against a boxer from the Leonard Neil stable, it emerged yesterday.
The bout, Dube’s first assignment across the Limpopo, was brokered by South African promoter Paul Tshehla following consultations with the Zimbabwe National Boxing Control Board and the boxer’s new management company, Fly High Boxing Promotions.
Tshehla revealed from Johannesburg this week that the Dube encounter will be one of several supporting bouts put together for the World Boxing Association welterweight title fight between Ishmael Kuchocha (Zimbabwe) and defending champion Welcome Ntshingila of South Africa.
Although the venue of the event was yet to be confirmed, Tshehla said, “This, I’m hopeful, will mark the beginning of a renewed long and convenient relationship between Harare and ourselves, as we last had such boxing relations way back in the early ’80s. February 7 will certainly herald the beginning of big things to come in as far as the sport is concerned”.
The SA promoter said he would also take another Zimbabwean champion, Wellington Phiri, to Namibia in early March for an international friendly match versus Jason Naule at Oranjemund. The package will comprise a total of eight fights (seven of them featuring South Africans) with the main draw-card being the WBA title fight between Tshehla’s son, Anthony, and Paulus ‘The Hitman’ Moses. – CAJ News.

Henry’s late strike stuns
By JOHN HUGHES
ENGLAND – Thierry Henry’s stoppage-time header snatched a 2-1 home win for Arsenal over table-topping Manchester United – and kept alive Chelsea’s dream of a third successive English Premiership title.
But stuttering Chelsea, six points behind in second place amid reports of internal unrest, slipped up again by losing 2-0 at Liverpool to early goals by Dirk Kuyt and Jermaine Pennant. For goalkeeper Petr Cech, wearing a protective headguard three months after fracturing his skull, it was an unhappy return.
Fifth-placed Bolton, harbouring hopes of European football next season, crashed 5-1 at Middlesbrough, local boy Stewart Downing setting up the first three goals before cracking in the fourth himself. El Hadji Diouf, Bolton’s Senegal frontman, was sent off for aiming a verbal volley at the referee.
Reading’s romantic run in their first Premiership season continued with a 3-1 home win over Sheffield United. But the match was marred by United’s Keith Gillespie being red-carded just 20 seconds after stepping off the bench and a mass touchline brawl that saw his manager Neil Warnock banished from the dugout.
□ Dutch striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink hit a hat-trick in Celtic’s 5-1 home demolition of St Mirren in the Scottish Premier. Celtic led the table by 17 points from Rangers who won 1-0 at Dunfermline.
□Manchester United host Portsmouth this Saturday in round 4 of the FA Cup. On Sunday, Arsenal and Chelsea are both at home, against Bolton and Nottingham Forest respectively.
World Cup warm-up
HARARE – Bangladesh are expected in Harare on February 1 for four one-day Internationals to be played between February 4 and 10, in a series that both teams will be using to finalise their 15-man squad for the World Cup.
Zimbabwe, who are still smarting from the 5-0 series humiliation suffered at the hands of the same opponents early last month, will be fighting to regain their pride.
It was the Tigers’ first-ever series whitewash and now Zimbabwean coach Kevin Curran and his charges will be out to turn the tables and gain confidence ahead of the World Cup. – Sports Reporter
Juniors placed third
WINDHOEK – Zimbabwe put up a spirited performance to finish third at the Southern Africa Junior Championships held in Windhoek last week.
Although not rated as favourites, the regional qualifying tournament saw seven Zimbabwean players qualifying for the Africa Junior championships to be held in Botswana in April.
South Africa finished on top, with Madagascar in second position.
The players who qualified were Mbonisi Ndimande, teamed up with Admire Mushonga, to beat South Africans Jason Black-Milner and Grant Ive 6-4, 6-2 in the doubles finals.
In the girls’ under-14 category, the Zimbabwe doubles team of Amanda Nkomba and Valeria Bhunu also made it to the next stage of the continental showcase.
Benjamin Locke, who was playing in the under-14 category, finished a credible fourth. – Sports Reporter
Hopes for turnaround
BULAWAYO – Highlanders hope to end a run of three attempts without going past first round of the African Champions League since the turn of the century, when they face Pamplemousse FC of Mauritius on January 28.
Highlanders should be boosted by the return of strikers Ralph Matema and Zenzo Moyo, who were nursing injuries.
Highlanders coach Methembe Ndlovu said he was going to field a strong team which will upset the Mauritians. – Sports Reporter
Genius wants victory
HARARE – Tennis star Genius Chidzikwe next week leaves for Burundi to take part in the Confederation of Africa Tennis Tournament, which starts on February 5.
Chidzikwe, who is expected to lead Zimbabwe’s onslaught during the Davis Cup in May, said he was looking at nothing short of victory at the US$5 000 tournament, and would use it to prepare for the Davis Cup.
Zimbabwe was relegated to group four after a disappointing 4-1 defeat by Greece in July last year. – Sports Reporter
Shoko suspended
HARARE – Gaths Mine middle and long-distance runner Kudakwashe Shoko and coach Percy Ngwenya have been suspended from taking part in any National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe events.
The decision to ban them was taken at the NAAZ meeting in Redcliff last week.
Shoko was suspended for two-weeks after failing to fulfil a fixture – the Sao Silvestre New Year’s Eve Marathon in Luanda, Angola on December 31. – Sports Reporter
Mutizirwa honoured
HARARE – Dynamos’ Sebastian Mutizirwa was last week named the club’s 2006 Player of the Year.
The 27-year-old striker ended the season with 17 league goals – and only a four-goal salvo by Highlanders’ striker Ralph Matema, in the very last game of the season, denied him the Golden Boot award.
He received $200 000 and also collected $150 000 for scoring 17 goals for the club.
There was also a reward for Edward Sadomba – a wing dynamo who played very well – when he was named the Most Disciplined Player and received $100 000.
Defender Tafadzwa Takawira was named the Most Improved Player and got $100000. Veteran midfielder Desmond Maringwa won the accolade for the Most Loyal Player and walked away with $100 000. – Sports Reporter

"ECA capacitates Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi in e-commerce tools and marketing strategies","She was speaking at the workshop on E-Commerce Marketing and Business Development Strategies for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Global Markets convened by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), through its African Institute for Economic Development and Planning (IDEP) and its Sub-Regional Office for Southern Africa (SROSA) and funded by the Government of Italy.
The overall objective of the workshop was to strengthen the skills of participants from Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe to leverage e-trade opportunities in the context of AfCFTA. Mr. Enrico de Agostini, Ambassador of Italy in Zambia reiterated the importance of capacity building of entrepreneurs in the region to ensure sustainable development.
Ms. Beatrice Mutali, United Nations Resident Coordinator, speaking on behalf of the UN family in Zambia underscored the importance of partnerships between governments, international partners, private sector and the UN to address the gaps in digital trade such as infrastructure, connectivity to payment systems and regulatory frameworks.
The Director of ECA Subregional office for Southern Africa, Ms. Eunice Kamwendo, in her opening remarks, emphasised the efforts of ECA in implementing innovative and practical initiatives in order to better support member states. An example of which is this e-commerce training that was intended to provide strategic and practical tools necessary to unlock opportunities in the e-commerce space under the AfCFTA and in global markets.
She further noted that, the AfCFTA, with its promise of a US$3.4 trillion single market, presents ECA and its partners with a unique platform to reimagine value chains, promote innovation, and stimulate sustainable growth driven by the private sector. “At ECA, we believe that digitalization when guided by inclusive policies and backed by the right skills can bridge development gaps, unlock new markets, and catalyze youth employment”.
To complement the training ECA-SROSA experts presented on the AfCFTA and initiatives related to the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement. Ms. Zodwa Mabuza, Chief Sub-Regional Initiatives outlined the protocol on digital trade indicating that it helps harmonize rules to boost Africa’s digital economy, cutting cross-border e-commerce costs, building trust, and supporting Small and Medium Enterprises. Ms. Bineswaree Bolaky, Economic Affairs Officer presented on the AfCFTA, its rationale and instruments, and on ECA’s work on AfCFTA, e-commerce and digital trade including outlining ECA’s support to member States on developing their National AfCFTA Strategies and Green Supplements to these strategies. Mr. Henry Lubinda, Programme Officer gave an overview of SRO-SA’s major areas of support to member States such as inclusive industrialization, green transitions, enhanced food systems and AfCFTA-led trade in Southern Africa.
The training consisting of 6 sessions, was facilitated by Mr. Fabio Santoni ASeS-CeFor, the implementing partner of the project funded by Italy. Participants were trained through scenarios and business simulation techniques.
At the closing of the workshop, certificates were remitted to participants by Mr. Aime Mbatkam, coordinator of the project at ECA’s training arm, the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning.
This collaborative initiative between ECA and the Government of Italy aimed at supporting Member states through a capacity building programme for the effective implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement. Under Phase 2, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Malawi, Mauritania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe benefitted from (i) an assessment of e-trade readiness and (ii) a capacity needs assessment of stakeholders for AfCFTA implementation.

"Father first, miner Second: Why a Gwanda artisanal miner puts family before all.","With the fear of losing his job and the little income he was getting at the end of each month weighing heavily on him, Zibusiso decided to leave his general hand job at one of the foreign-owned commercial gold mines in Gwanda. He became one among thousands of people who had joined the gold mining rush at small scale artisanal mining sites across the country as the deteriorating economic situation continued to affect the population.
But life has not been as kind as he hoped it would be. After 20 years, Zibusiso is still here. The promises of gold have faded, but his determination remains.
“There is not so much change”, Zibusiso recounts. “Life is not as good as people think it is for miners. We go for two months without an income. To survive, we must borrow from our ‘sponsors’* who will then recover their money once we realise any profits”, adds Zibusiso.
Regardless, Zibusiso continues to toil daily to meet the basic needs of his family of six children, four of them still in school, and a wife he met in 2003 in Tshebetshebe, just two years after he arrived in 2001.
“On a good day, we make between 500 to 1,500 Rands. But good days are rare,” he says.
Daily, Zibusiso works long hours underground in mine shafts that are anything between 30 and 300 metres deep. He is painfully aware of the dangers – unstable shafts, toxic dust and harmful chemicals, and the ever-present risk of injury, yet, driven by the need to provide for his family, he soldiers on, armed with little more than a shovel, plastic containers, a hammer and a wheelbarrow among other basic mining equipment-no safety gear, no personal protective equipment. This exposes him and many other small-scale artisanal miners to serious health conditions such as respiratory issues, silicosis, tuberculosis and physical injuries.
“It’s dangerous, I know, but these are the sacrifices we make for our loved ones,” says Zibusiso. “My family comes first. I make sure that I support them from the proceeds I get from mining. This means that things such as protective clothing and proper mining equipment are not a huge priority for me.”
Zibusiso’s family lives about five kilometres from the mine. They visit every two to three weeks to check up on him and collect money for the family’s basic needs. Sadly, Zibusiso’s eldest daughter was home when we met him as he was yet to pay school fees for her and three other siblings two weeks after schools had opened.
*Sponsors for gold mining are individuals who typically provide funding, equipment, food and other necessities to a group of artisanal miners. In exchange, the small-scale artisanal miners (also known as othseketstha in Ndebele), pay some proceeds from the sale of gold and give a certain percentage to these sponsors for their support.
“As you can see, she is still home because I haven’t been able to raise school fees yet, but I hope that I will get something so I can pay the school.”
While the economic situation has not changed much for Zibusiso, he has found a ray of hope on the healthcare side. In the past, he and his colleagues could not even afford to take time off work to seek treatment, often enduring severe symptoms silently.
But now things have improved due to a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) comprehensive health outreach programme, as artisanal miners and the host community can now access healthcare services.
The outreach programme aims to bridge the health services gap and bring essential healthcare services directly to the miners’ doorsteps. Through the Artisanal Small-Scale Gold Mining Basic Healthcare project (ASGM-BHC), MSF works hand in hand with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to deliver free, accessible care to over 30 mining sites in the Gwanda district. The project offers screenings, treatment for common illnesses, mental health support, and health education, all while working closely with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to improve service delivery for hard-to-reach communities.
“We used to walk long distances of up to 5km to the nearest clinic. Sometimes we would commute to Gwanda which is about 20km away to receive treatment. Besides paying for treatment, getting the service itself was hard because sometimes medication was not available regardless of time spent in queues and travel time. We would only seek treatment when one’s health condition deteriorated because we did not always have the money and time to do so. Our work demands that we work every day, this is how one gets more money, and in the spirit of teamwork, you cannot be away from work,” Zibusiso says.
“For the first time in 24 years of my experience as an artisanal miner, I had never experienced this. We are getting treatment for almost everything here, where we work. We are now receiving treatment for most of the conditions here at the mine. TB, HIV and STIs are very common conditions affecting miners,” Zibusiso says.
Artisanal miners like Zibusiso are often criminalised or forgotten, operating in informal spaces where survival is the only constant but he is grateful to MSF for giving him and his fellow miners a health life line to enable them to at least work for the betterment of their families with less worry on their health needs and that of their families.

Zimbabwe sets new 300m kg tobacco output,"Zimbabwe has set a new tobacco production record after more than 300 million kilo of leaf tobacco worth over $1 billon have been sold since the marketing season opened in March, the country’s industry regulatory body announced on Wednesday.
The Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) confirmed that Zimbabwe has officially surpassed its all-time national tobacco production record of 296 million kilogrammes achieved in 2023, after this year’s seasonal cumulative sales reached over 300 million kg on Wednesday.
“This year’s marketing season has been historic. As of June 18, Zimbabwe has sold over 300 million kg of tobacco, a new and all-time record,” Chelesani Tsarwe, a TIMB public affairs officer, told Xinhua in an interview, adding that the one-billion-dollar revenue for farmers is another milestone worth celebrating.
She noted that while the production milestone reflects resilience and hard work across the value chain, the ideal future is not just about record volumes, but also about increased local processing, enhanced farmer earnings, diversified markets, and environmentally sustainable practices in the tobacco sector.
“We must shift from volume-driven horizontal growth to value-driven growth,” she said.
In 2021, Zimbabwe launched a tobacco value chain transformation plan, aiming to increase leaf tobacco production to 300 million kilos annually and transform the industry into a $5 billion industry by 2025.
As a pillar of Zimbabwe’s economy, tobacco is primarily exported to China and South Africa, among other countries, significantly contributing to export earnings and rural livelihoods.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/zimbabwe-sets-new-300m-kg-tobacco-output/,2025-06-20 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,
South Africa pick five uncapped players for Zimbabwe Tests,"The two-match Test series will take place at Queen Sports Club, Bulawayo, from 28 June to 10 July. The series will be South Africa’s first outing after the World Test Championship Final 2025.
Bavuma will continue as captain, which sees several Test team regulars like Kagiso Rabada, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs rested.
In their place, Lhuan-dré Pretorius, Lesego Senokwane, Codi Yusuf, Dewald Brevis and Prenelan Subrayen find a place. All the players are yet to make their Test debut, while this is a maiden call-up for Pretorius, Senokwane and Yusuf.
Lhuan-dré Pretorius is the rising teen sensation of South African cricket. He had a breakout season in the CSA 4-Day Series, scoring three centuries and finishing with an impressive average of 72.66.
Joining him as another exciting prospect is Lesego Senokwane, who also amassed 559 runs in the first-class competition, including three hundreds. Both players recently made their South Africa ‘A ‘ debuts in the series against West Indies A, signaling their rapid rise through the ranks.
Codi Yusuf is an exciting pace prospect, who picked 23 wickets in the 4-Day Series, at an average of 22.39.
Subrayen and Brevis are uncapped at the Test level but have travelled with the side before. Subrayen was on full fire against West Indies ‘A’ in a recent first-class fixture, picking up a five-wicket haul and scoring 64 runs in an innings win for South Africa ‘A’. Brevis has impressed ever since having made his mark at the U19 level, and was the second-highest run-getter in the domestic first-class level this past season.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/south-africa-pick-five-uncapped-players-for-zimbabwe-tests/,2025-07-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,
Zimbabwe’s farmers push on as land grab compensation flounders,"KWEKWE – In a field of paprika plants in the heart of Zimbabwe, fourth-generation farmer Daniel Burger and relative newcomer Miriam Mupambawashe discuss the quality of the crop.
Burger, 36, and Mupambawashe, 59, are neighbours and partners in efforts to revive the country’s once-flourishing agriculture sector cut down by a ruinous land reform drive in the 2000s.
The reform distributed land from the white minority, which still owned most of the best farmland 20 years after independence in 1980, to the black majority.
Around 4,000 white-owned farms were confiscated, some with deadly violence.
Mupambawashe was among thousands who received land. Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.
Other farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others — including politicians who were handed land — uninterested.
There were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.
“There was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent,” Burger told AFP.
“But being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward,” he said.
Mupambawashe moved to the area from Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres away.
“When we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built,” she said. “Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.”
“They never let us down and said, ‘You grabbed the farm, let’s see if you can do it’. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.”
It was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were “embarrassing”, Mupambawashe said.
But today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.
Burger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.
His family’s land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.
Nonetheless, “For a long time we became wound up in compensation,” said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.
“But it wasn’t our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward,” he said.
Compensation frustration
This year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.
The process has been complex and divisive.
The government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.
It announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.
Unable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.
In April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.
Deon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.
The bonds are “unsecured” and there is “limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government,” he told AFP.
“The general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything,” Theron said.
But the Property and Farm Compensation Association said its members would take what is on offer.
The bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that “digging in” and seeking more from the government would be futile.
Mupambawashe and Burger are encouraged by another major government announcement — the granting of land ownership rights to beneficiaries of the 2000s land reform.
The tenure announced late last year replaces 99-year leases and means the new owners can deal with the property as they wish, including putting it up for sale.
“It makes us feel settled,” Mupambawashe said. “No one could come and tell us to move off the land or take it away from us.”
“It is just going to catapult us forward as a nation and an economy,” Burger said. “We used to be the breadbasket of Africa and we lost it somewhat. But I just look at where we are now.” – AFP

Why are Zimbabwe Police Chasing Off Some of the Economy’s Biggest Players?,"HARARE, ZIMBABWE — The vendors rarely see it coming. The municipal police, some in plainclothes and others in uniform, move through the crowd silent and unnoticed. When they finally strike, panic erupts. Vendors scatter, trampling their goods and grabbing what they can. A few are arrested. Their wares are seized and tossed into the back of a police truck.
“They have no mercy at all. Once they take your stock, you’ll never get it back,” says Saul Nhema, an informal vendor who has been selling vegetables for three months after losing his job as a construction worker.
On the day of this interview, the municipal police had already raided these informal vendors selling along Park Street in Harare’s central business district twice. As Global Press Journal reporters interviewed Nhema, they struck again. He grabbed his stock and fled in the middle of the interview.
The Harare City Council has for years waged such crackdowns on vendors, often destroying goods and deploying heavy police forces. Local government insists these crackdowns are necessary to enforce city bylaws, citing vending from illegal spots, littering and health concerns.
Yet the scale and intensity of recent operations, backed by expanding police presence and significant public spending, have raised questions. Critics argue that the government is wasting scarce resources targeting informal vendors all while it struggles to provide city residents with basic services, such as clean water.
In 2024, the council’s revenue stood at just US$3 million. But policing costs for these crackdowns exceeded US$24 million, eight times the council’s income.
In 2025, the council escalated its crackdown by creating a specialized police unit to target vendors, further deepening the financial strain with a slight budget increase — and pushing the total to around 12 times its income, which is projected to fall to just US$2 million.
As the council’s income dwindles, the central government shoulders much of the financial burden.
Global Press Journal made numerous requests for an interview with the mayor. He did not respond.
The additional cost of the special police unit is hard to justify, given the potential benefits of supporting informal vendors, says Reuben Akili, director of the Combined Harare Residents Association.
“If we examine the funds allocated for enforcement covering salaries, fuel and operational costs, those resources could have been redirected toward rehabilitating markets or public restrooms in the city,” Akili says.
The informal sector already sustains over 80% of Zimbabwe’s population and contributes nearly 72% to the country’s gross domestic product. Street vendors dominate the sector in many African countries, accounting for over 85% of jobs, many held by women.
In Zimbabwe, the vendors are becoming increasingly critical, as the country’s currency crisis forces many retail shops to shut down.
Despite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.
A special municipal police unit to push out this critical population in Harare will only inflate the city’s workforce, which ultimately burdens taxpayers, Akili says. Instead, he says the council should build infrastructure where vendors can comfortably work.
“Did that result in any significant change in terms of the challenges that we are seeing? I think it’s a big no,” Wadzai says.
At times, vendors resort to bribing officers to avoid the disruption of evictions. Jesman Guvheya has worked as an informal vendor for two years. The widowed mother of five says the police sometimes demand US$1 a day from each vendor.
“But there can be three or four groups that move at different times per day and you may end up paying 4 US dollars to avoid being raided,” she says.
And that bribe is never a guarantee one will trade without interruption. The police could swoop in and confiscate everything, even after a vendor has paid the bribe. “Sometimes we are left with little stock that we will have secured elsewhere,” she says, preparing to flee from police she has just spotted.
Although Guvheya escaped arrest that day, her son, also a street vendor, wasn’t as fortunate. The council police apprehended him, and she had to follow the truck to pay a bribe so he could be freed.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/why-are-zimbabwe-police-chasing-off-some-of-the-economys-biggest-players/,2025-09-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Jude Bellingham’s Rise: How He’s Redefining Real Madrid’s Future,"Jude Bellingham’s Rise: Redefining Real Madrid’s Future
At just 22, Jude Bellingham has already carved out a legacy that most footballers can only dream of. While fans check football scores from today’s games, it’s Bellingham’s performances they’re most eager to see – a testament to how he’s become must-watch football. From his early days at Birmingham City to becoming Real Madrid’s midfield heartbeat since his 2023 transfer, his journey defies expectations. With a rare blend of technical brilliance, leadership beyond his years, and that undeniable swagger, Bellingham isn’t just shaping Los Blancos’ future-he’s redefining the modern midfielder role. Let’s break down the most captivating storylines of his meteoric rise and why the Bernabéu can’t stop chanting his name.
A Star Born in Birmingham
Bellingham’s story starts in the heart of England, where he debuted for Birmingham City at 16, breaking records as the club’s youngest-ever player. By 17, he was captaining the side, showing a maturity that belied his age. His move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020 was a bold step, and he thrived in the Bundesliga, earning praise for his work rate and vision. When Real Madrid paid €103 million for him in 2023, some wondered if the price tag was too steep for a teenager. Two years later, it’s clear: Bellingham was a bargain.
What makes his rise so captivating? It’s his ability to adapt. Whether it’s Dortmund’s high-pressing system or Real Madrid’s possession-based style, Bellingham fits like a glove. His versatility-playing as a box-to-box midfielder, a No. 10, or even a defensive anchor-has made him indispensable. Fans and analysts are buzzing about how he’s redefining the midfield role, blending physicality with finesse.
The Heart of Real Madrid’s New Era
Real Madrid has always been a club of superstars, from Zinedine Zidane to Cristiano Ronaldo. But with legends like Luka Modric and Toni Kroos nearing the end of their careers, the club needed a new face. Enter Bellingham. His impact was immediate: in his first season, he scored 19 goals and provided 6 assists in La Liga, numbers unheard of for a midfielder his age. His knack for clutch moments-like his stoppage-time winner against Barcelona in El Clásico-has cemented his status as a fan favourite.
But it’s not just about stats. Bellingham brings an energy that galvanizes the squad. Despite his youth, his leadership is evident in how he rallies teammates during tense moments. Off the pitch, his charm and fluency in Spanish have won over the Bernabéu faithful. Search trends show fans are obsessed with his personality, with queries like “Jude Bellingham interview” and “Bellingham celebration” spiking on Google. He’s not just a player; he’s a brand, and Real Madrid is building its future around him.
Bellingham’s Reign Begins: Can He Conquer Europe, England & Global Stardom in 2025?
As Bellingham continues to shine, here are the key storylines that make his journey a must-watch:
Can He Lead Real Madrid to Champions League Glory?
Bellingham played a pivotal role in Real Madrid’s 2024 Champions League triumph, but can he take the reins as the club’s leader in future campaigns? With Kylian Mbappé now in the squad, the duo’s chemistry could be unstoppable-or a challenge to balance.
Will He Become England’s Greatest?
Bellingham’s performances for England, especially at the 2026 World Cup, will be crucial. Fans are already searching for “Bellingham England captain,” hinting at his potential to lead the Three Lions to silverware.
How Will He Shape the Midfield?
With Modric and Kroos phasing out, Bellingham is the linchpin alongside younger stars like Eduardo Camavinga and Federico Valverde. His ability to dictate play and mentor others will define Real Madrid’s midfield for years.
Global Stardom Awaits
Bellingham’s marketability is skyrocketing. He’s becoming a global icon, from endorsement deals to social media buzz (his Instagram posts regularly trend). Searches for “Jude Bellingham net worth” and “Bellingham boots” show fans are also invested in his off-field journey.
Why Bellingham Matters
What sets Bellingham apart is his relatability. While pundits dissect yesterday’s matches, it’s his consistency that stands out-the kid who grew up dreaming of the big stage delivers week after week, just like millions of fans hope to. His work ethic, humility, and pure love for the game resonate globally, yet he’s also that rare generational talent who blends physical dominance with a footballing IQ that leaves opponents bewildered. Scrolling through X, you’ll see fans hail him as “the complete package” after every performance. And honestly? They’re not wrong.
As Real Madrid transitions into a new era, Bellingham is the cornerstone. His rise isn’t just about personal accolades; it’s about carrying a club with unmatched history into the future. Whether it’s his jaw-dropping goals, leadership, or infectious passion, Bellingham is rewriting the script for what a midfielder can be. Keep an eye on him-because the football world can’t look away.

Zimbabwe Losing US$4 Billion To Looting Annually - Biti,"In his remarks reflecting on the current state of the economy, Biti said the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April 2024 marked the beginning of what he called “economic carnage,” with massive consequences for production, employment, and livelihoods. Biti said:
There is carnage in the economy. The introduction of the ZIG in April 2024 marked a significant slide towards collapse, deceleration and shrinkage. The ZiG-induced depression has seen companies close or exit and a massive devaluation of social services.
The former minister, who oversaw economic stabilisation during the Government of National Unity (GNU) era from 2009 to 2013, said the retail sector is buckling under the combined pressures of exchange rate volatility, high taxation, overregulation, and a rapidly expanding informal economy that now dominates urban commerce.
Biti pointed to the worsening power supply crisis as a key driver of economic deterioration, accusing the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) of failing to meet energy demands necessary to sustain industrial activity and protect jobs.
Beyond structural inefficiencies, Biti highlighted rampant corruption at the heart of government operations as a major drag on economic recovery. He said:
Public procurement, fuel, commodities, and Treasury disbursements have become major centres of looting. Easily, US$4 is being lost annually through blatant looting by political cartels and bandits.
Biti was particularly critical of the monetary authorities’ handling of the exchange rate and currency reforms, describing the ZiG dollar as a “myth” designed to enable state-backed extraction through manipulation and fraud.
Despite authorities’ efforts to promote the local unit, Biti noted that 80% of all transactions in Zimbabwe are still conducted in US dollars, revealing the collapse of confidence in the new currency. He said:
De-dollarisation is a failed ritual, with 80 % of all transactions done in US$. The ZIG$ is a myth, a lie, imposed to guarantee extraction through exchange manipulation and fraud.
He warned that mismanagement of exchange controls has fueled hyperinflation and wiped out the real value of public sector wages, pushing civil servants into poverty.
The human cost of the economic implosion is already visible. Biti pointed out that university lecturers have been on strike since April, citing eroded wages, and over 5,000 teachers have exited public service, unable to survive on current salaries.

Proteas batters dominate opening day in Zimbabwe warm-up,"Ahead of the all-important Ultimate Test against Australia at Lord’s in a week, the South Africa players hit the ground running in a warm-up fixture against Zimbabwe in Arundel.
Even as the two African sides feature in the practice game, the South African minds were focussed on the Australian challenge ahead.
Speaking on the tussle to follow this contest, opening batter Aiden Markram outlined the Proteas’ mindset for the World Test Championship Final.
“I think it’s the collective decision for each guy to bring their best skill. It’s going to be a tough game,” Markram told ICC Digital.
“It’s a Test match, of course, against Australia and a Dukes ball, Lord’s, all those sorts of things, but ultimately, the guys have a skillset that have got them here, got them selected, throughout the cycle performed as well, doing those skills.
“So it’s about backing that, our best skill versus their (Australia’s) best skill, and we’ll see where it lands us at the end of the day.”
The first day of the encounter was washed out, but the Proteas got much-needed game practice on Day 2.
The South Africa batters got a good workout after the side opted to bat in the warm-up clash.
Despite losing Aiden Markram for 13 early in the day, the Proteas batting unit picked it up as half-centuries from Ryan Rickelton, skipper Temba Bavuma, and in-form Tristan Stubbs led them to a formidable total of 313/2, following which they declared their innings.
Rickelton (62 off 93), Bavuma (58 off 85) and Stubbs (58 off 120) displayed their class with the bat, with a variety of shots catching eyes as the Proteas aim to go all-out to secure their first ICC trophy since 1998.
There were suggestions that the Proteas had zeroed in on Wiaan Mulder as their No. 3 batter, with the player walking out after Markram’s loss early in the innings. He added 26 runs during his resolute knock at the crease.
As several batters opted to retire hurt not out, as many as nine South Africa batters got an opportunity to feature in the first innings.
Walking in at six & seven respectively were Tony de Zorzi and David Bedingham, who contributed with 28 and 23 in Arundel.
Following South Africa’s declaration at 313/2, Zimbabwe’s time with the bat got off to a shaky start with Kagiso Rabada getting rid of Brian Bennett for 15.
Rabada and Jansen warmed up quite well with the ball, with the duo sharing the opening eight overs and were looking in fine shape as Zimbabwe concluded the day at 48/1 with Nicholas Welch and Sean Williams on the wicket.
With two more days of play left, the Proteas will be vying for more valuable time on the field to fine-tune themselves ahead of the challenge against Australia.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/06/proteas-batters-dominate-opening-day-in-zimbabwe-warm-up/,2025-05-06 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,business,

Greening China’s ‘brown steel’ investments in Zimbabwe,"Used in infrastructure, vehicles, electricals and much else, steel is a common material in developed countries but is scant in Africa. In 2023, globally, 219 kg of steel was used per person in new products. In sub-Saharan Africa, the per capita consumption was around 30 kg, which is just 14 per cent of the global average.
To change this narrative, two Chinese multinationals, Tsingshan Holding Group and Xinganglian Metallurgical are investing over £3.8 billion in Zimbabwe’s steel industry. Zimbabwe will become Africa’s biggest producer of steel surpassing the current leaders South Africa, Egypt and Morocco. This investment comes at a critical time for Africa as it seeks to reduce its infrastructure deficit. However, most of this steel investment will produce fossil-fuel based ‘brown’ which could potentially hold Zimbabwe and Africa back from fulfilling its ‘green’ steel production potential.
Brown steel vs Green steel
Steel production requires significant energy. It involves heating iron ore or scrap metal to extremely high temperatures (often above 1,000°C) to melt and transform it into steel. Brown steel refers to steel produced using conventional, fossil fuel-based energy such as coal. Green steel is produced with a focus on sustainability, using renewable energy sources and minimizing carbon emissions. Both the Dinson and Palm River Steel projects have coal as their primary source of energy with renewable energy sources providing only a minor contribution.
There are some simple reasons for this. Firstly, coal is cheap to produce. Secondly, steel has traditionally been produced with coal as the main energy source. In traditional production, coal is used as a reducing agent to extract iron from iron ore, as an energy source to provide the high temperatures needed for the steelmaking process, and to help remove impurities and achieve the desired chemical composition. Because of this, the global steel industry is responsible for 9 per cent of global carbon emissions.
The world is increasingly paying attention to how dirty the steel industry is, and concerted efforts are being made to make a shift. Among them are Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) law, which will come into effect in 2026. This European Union (EU) regulation aims to put a price on the carbon emissions of goods imported into the EU. The stated aim is to level the regulatory playing field between EU and foreign producers and reduce carbon leakage, where production is outsourced to places with less stringent environmental protections. This law will affect brown steel investment because CBAM will progressively limit brown steel and products made from brown steel such as car frames for electrical vehicles uncompetitive in the European market. This presents an opportunity for green steel producers, but Zimbabwe may be locking in its brown steel production for years to come.
The Zimbabwean government was the first African country to report its Nationally Determined Contributions Plans that lay outline ambitious targets for emissions reduction, climate resilience, and green economic growth by 2035. Coal emissions in the energy sector were singled out as having to be reduced. The production of brown steel will hamper those efforts. Coal production has turned mining areas and towns into environmental sacrifice zones disproportionately affecting local populations. Dinson Energy for example is mining coal in Hwange to power the steel plant in Manhize exacerbating the 100-year-old colonial consequences of coal mining in the Hwange area. The town is being locked in fossil fuel extraction leading to stranded assets, skills and a dying town because of the lack of transition planning towards a decarbonized global economy.
Green steel
Demand for streel is expected to increase by a third over the next 30 years. This is largely due to growth in Asia and Africa. This makes it more imperative that the industry moves from brown to green steel production.
The technologies required for this to happen are already available. Although not the primary energy source, both new plants in Zimbabwe will have electric arc furnaces which unlike blast furnace, do not need coal to power steel production.
Nearly 30 per cent of global steel is now made through electric arc furnaces gradually chipping away at fossil fuel-based production. Both investments can also use green hydrogen from Namibia to reduce iron ore instead of coal. There will be reduced carbon emissions since there will less to coal being used in the steel plants increasing the steel industry’s alignment with Zimbabwe NDC plans.
Moreover, the Chinese firms investing in Zimbabwe have the latest technology in green hydrogen and electric arc furnaces to make this shift. Bringing in the latest technology on this front will enhance the transfer of skills training from Chinese to local engineers and technicians happening at both steel production sites. This is exemplified through the Shanxi Engineering Vocational college and Harare Polytechnic partnership under the Palm River Energy project.
Beyond producing crude steel, there is massive potential to add value and produce stainless steel. Blessed with energy transition minerals such as nickel and chromium, these is potential for value addition of the minerals leading to a more sustainable and valuable industrial value chain growing in Zimbabwe.
The Palm River Energy project plans to produce one million tonnes a year of stainless steel using the critical energy transition mineral of chromium from Zimbabwe. Dinson’s parent company, Tsingshan is a dominant player in stainless steel production controlling about 25 per cent of the global market primarily through its Indonesia operations. Although Tsingshan has previously raised concerns on the viability of producing stainless steel which also requires nickel which is not found in abundance in Zimbabwe, the potential is still there considering the potential to source nickel from Tanzania, which will also enhance intra-African trade, a key goal of African nations.
Greater cooperation between African countries
The dominant narrative that has come out of these projects is that they are a much-needed boon for Zimbabwe’s manufacturing industry. Although correct, both projects success is reliant on stronger collaboration with the rest of Africa’s economies to meet their potential. The Africa Free Trade Agreement means that the steel produced in Zimbabwe has a ready market in Africa. There is a need for cooperation with South Africa steel companies which are currently in decline to ensure there is no under-cutting of each other’s steel industries which will have a net-negative impact on Africa’s slice of the global steel industry. Cooperating with Namibia will also provide access to green hydrogen which is a key ingredient in producing green steel and potentially nickel from Tanzania.
The move from brown to green steel production is not only an environmental imperative but also an economic necessity to prepare Zimbabwe’s steel investment for a decarbonised world. The Dinson and Palm River Energy projects are much needed initiatives that can propel greater technology transfer, value addition and greater cooperation amongst African countries’ supply and value networks. An increase in the per capita use of steel will be a definite indicator of Africa’s growing industrialisation.

Zimbabwe deploys drones along Mozambique border to curb smuggling - report,"The drones, operational since May 1, 2025, are being used extensively along key smuggling hotspots, including the Forbes Border Post, which links Manicaland Province to Mozambique’s Manica Province. The new surveillance initiative has reportedly led to a decline in smuggling activities and an increase in arrests.
Zimbabwe’s Minister of State for Manicaland Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Advocate Misheck Mugadza, confirmed the development and praised the role drones are playing in bolstering border security.
“We have seen a notable decline in smuggling cases. Our security forces are vigilant and on top of the situation, thanks to the added surveillance capabilities provided by the drones,” said Mugadza. “They are also serving as a deterrent and helping to identify individuals involved in illegal activities.”
The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority’s (ZIMRA) acting Commissioner for Customs and Excise, Mr Adrian Swarres, echoed Mugadza’s sentiments, highlighting the strategic benefits of drone technology.
“Drones offer rapid deployment and real-time intelligence. With a borderline of over 700 kilometres, drones have dramatically increased the area under surveillance and reduced the need for extensive ground patrols,” he said.
Police have also seen a rise in smuggling-related arrests. Acting Manicaland provincial police spokesperson, Assistant Inspector Wiseman Chinyoka, confirmed the trend, though he said specific figures were not immediately available.
Field investigations by The Manica Post show that the crackdown has led some former smugglers to abandon the illicit trade. Dudzai Macheso, from Hauna in Honde Valley, said he had quit smuggling bales of second-hand clothes and opened a grocery shop instead.
“Smuggling has become too risky with drones watching the border. I decided to start a legitimate business,” said Macheso.
Meanwhile, authorities are not only relying on technology. A special police taskforce recently engaged in a fatal shootout with suspected smugglers, resulting in three arrests and the seizure of vehicles and contraband, including bales of clothing and shoes valued at thousands of dollars.
Infrastructure
During a recent inspection of Forbes Border Post, Zimbabwe’s Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube announced infrastructure development plans.
“We have concessioned the redevelopment of Forbes Border Post to private investors who have demonstrated their capabilities at Beitbridge. We expect a modern and efficient facility,” said Ncube.
The revamp is part of a broader government strategy to introduce computerised and online border management systems at all ports of entry, aimed at improving efficiency, curbing corruption, and strengthening border control.
Zimbabwe’s Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Kazembe Kazembe recently announced the rollout of an integrated border management system that will link civil registry, police, and immigration departments. Most of the necessary hardware is already in place, with the installation of e-gates pending.
“The system includes facial recognition technology and online automation to cut queues and reduce human error,” said Kazembe during a tour of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport immigration department.
Additionally, plans are underway to open new formal entry points at Honde Valley and Cashel Valley to help decongest Forbes Border Post.
Zimbabwe’s intensified focus on border control forms part of its wider national strategy to enhance security, streamline trade, and improve the travel experience for both citizens and visitors.

Ibhetshu LikaZulu remembers the 21 mothers burned alive during Gukurahundi,"This reminder comes as the world celebrated Mother’s Day on 11 May, honouring the sacrifices and love of mothers.
However, for Ibhetshu LikaZulu, the day also brought back devastating memories of how “innocent” women, daughters, and sisters, were slaughtered in a “calculated act of extermination”.
The 1983 massacre in Emkhonyeni stands as one of the most brutal episodes of the Gukurahundi genocide, where an estimated 20 000 civilians were killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade between 1983 and 1987.
The 21 women were reportedly locked in a hut and set ablaze.
Ibhetshu LikaZulu’s Secretary-General, Mbuso Fuzwayo said these women were Sikhangezile Msipha, Deliwe Ndlovu, Concilia Ncube, Sikhathele Ndlovu, Masalu Ndlovu, Senzeni Sibanda, Betty Sibanda, Singatsho Sibanda, Musa Ncube, Elitha Ngwane, Eva Tshuma, and others, who he lamented remain largely absent from Zimbabwe’s official history.
In a statement released on May 11, Fuzwayo, said the commemoration of Mother’s Day must also confront Zimbabwe’s unresolved history of state-sponsored violence, particularly the atrocities committed against women during the Gukurahundi era.
“On this Mother’s Day, Ibhetshu LikaZulu extends heartfelt solidarity and reverence to all mothers in Zimbabwe and across the world,” Fuzwayo said.
“Today, we celebrate the courage, resilience, and unwavering love of mothers who continue to defy all odds to nurture, protect, and provide for their children and families, often under dire circumstances shaped by Zimbabwe’s ongoing economic collapse, a direct result of decades of misrule by the Zanu PF regime.”
He painted a grim picture of the daily struggles Zimbabwean women endure daily while condemning the state’s refusal to acknowledge past atrocities.
“In the face of spiraling inflation, joblessness, and systemic neglect, Zimbabwean mothers stand as the last line of defense against hunger, despair, and family disintegration. They are the ones who wake before dawn, search for food, fetch water from distant boreholes, endure humiliations at hospitals with no medication and walk long distances so their children might learn,” he said. “These women embody the spirit of sacrifice and dignity amidst a monstrous economy that continues to punish the innocent and reward the corrupt.”
Turning to the 21 women, Fuzwayo said “their only ‘crime’ was the potential to give birth to more of those whom the regime sought to annihilate.”
“This calculated and evil act, setting women alight, was not only a gross violation of human rights but a spiritual and generational wound. It robbed children of their mothers. It condemned survivors to lifetimes of unhealed trauma. It created orphans not only in body but in soul,” he said.
Despite decades passing, no official memorial exists, no perpetrator has been prosecuted, and the government’s approach to reconciliation has been widely criticised as superficial.
“This atrocity, one among countless others committed during the Gukurahundi genocide, remains unacknowledged by the very government that carried it out. There has been no remorse. No memorialisation. No justice,” Fuzwayo lamented.
“Instead, we witness attempts to sanitise the past through choreographed ‘reconciliation’ processes that serve only the political elite, while survivors are re-traumatized and excluded. These are side shows. These are spectacles of deceit. They are profiteering ventures cloaked in the language of peace, while the truth lies buried, both literally and metaphorically, in shallow graves and silenced testimonies.”
On Mother’s Day, Ibhetshu LikaZulu did not merely call for remembrance, but for tangible action.
“We demand: A full and public acknowledgment of the Emkhonyeni massacre and all Gukurahundi atrocities; A survivor-centered truth-telling and reconciliation process, independent of government manipulation; Justice for the families of the victims and Memorialisation of the women who died, whose names and stories must be etched into the national conscience.”
Fuzwayo concluded with a rallying cry for truth and justice.
“Let this day not pass as mere sentiment. Let it be a rallying cry for justice, dignity, and remembrance. We honour not only the nurturing hands of mothers but the blood of the fallen. We will not forget. We will not be silenced,” he said.",https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2025/05/ibhetshu-likazulu-remembers-the-21-mothers-burned-alive-during-gukurahundi/,2025-05-14 00:00:00,TheZimbabwean,politics,
